["Mineral Nutrition Mineral nutrition in plants Every living organisms need carbohydrates, proteins, fats, water, and minerals to live. Similarly, plants need nutrients for growth and development. Methods to study the mineral requirement of plants • Hydroponics is a technique in which plants are grown in nutrient solution instead of soil. This technique is used at the time of commercial production of vegetables. It is also used to study the mineral deficiency diseases in plants. • Aeroponics is the technique in which nutrients are sprayed suspended in the air. Essential mineral elements Different plants have different mineral requirements. There is criterion for the essentiality of an element. It includes- • The element must be necessary for normal growth and reproduction. In the absence of that element the plants will not be able to complete its life cycle. • The requirement of the element must be specific, and it should not be replaceable by any another element. • The element must be directly involved in the metabolism of the plant. The mineral elements needed by the plant is divided into- macronutrients and micronutrients Macronutrients: These elements are needed by the plants in large quantities. It includes carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulphur, potassium, calcium and magnesium. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are obtained mainly from CO 2 and H 2 O. Others are absorbed from the soil as mineral nutrition. Micronutrients These are the nutrients that are needed by the plants in small quantity. It includes iron, manganese, copper, molybdenum, zinc, boron, chlorine and nickel. Essential elements are grouped in different categories based on their diverse functions such as- • Essential elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen serves as components of various biomolecules such as amino acids, lipids and hence structural elements of cells • Essential elements are major components of chemical compounds related to energy such as magnesium ion in chlorophyll and phosphorous in ATP. • Essential elements also influence enzyme action by acting as activator and inhibitor of certain enzymes. For example, Mg 2+ activates both ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase and 1 ","phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase. Both of these are essential in carbon fixation.  Zn 2+ activates alcohol dehydrogenase and Mo is essential for nitrogenase activity during nitrogen metabolism. • Some essential elements control osmolarity of a cell. Potassium ions control the opening and closing of stomata. Role of macronutrients and micronutrients The role of different macro and micronutrients are given below- Nitrogen • Essential element required by the plants in large quantities. • It is absorbed by the plants in the form of nitrate ions (NO 3 ) -and some plants also absorb in the form of nitrite ions(NO 2 ) -or ammonium ions (NH 4 ) + • Needed by the plants for actively growing tissues such as meristematic tissues. • It is a necessary component of vitamins. • Directly involved in photosynthesis. Phosphorous • It is absorbed by the plants in the form of phosphate ions (PO 4 ) 3-• It is major component of cell membranes, proteins, nucleic acids and nucleotides. • Promotes root formation and growth. • Required for seed formation. • Involved in energy storage and transfer. Potassium • It is absorbed by the plants in the form of potassium ions . • It is abundant in actively growing tissues such as meristematic tissues, buds, leaves and root tips. • It is required for maintaining osmotic potential in a cell which is responsible for opening and closing of the stomata . • Increases the rate of photosynthesis • Essential for protein synthesis Calcium • It is absorbed by the plants in the form of calcium ions(Ca 2+ ) • Required for continuous cell division and growth. • Involved in nitrogen metabolism. • It is present in the middle lamella in the form of calcium pectate . 2 ","• It is also required for the formation of mitotic spindle • It is also required for the activation of the certain enzymes. Magnesium • It is absorbed by the plants in the form of magnesium ions(Mg 2+ ) • It is required for the activation of the enzymes involved in respiration, photosynthesis. • It is involved in the synthesis of RNA and DNA. • Key component of chlorophyll. • It also maintains ribosome structure. Sulphur • Absorbed in the form of sulphate ions(SO 4 ) 2-• Integral component of amino acids such as methionine. • Component of several coenzymes vitamins such as thiamine, biotin, and ferrodoxin . • Helps in seed production • Required for chlorophyll formation Iron • Plants absorb iron mainly in the form of ferric ions(Fe 3+ ) • Important for cell division and growth. • Participates in electron transfer during various metabolic reactions. • It is important for the activation of an enzyme catalase that is required for chlorophyll formation. • Serves as oxygen carrier. Manganese • It is absorbed in the form of manganese ions (Mn 2+ ). • It is involved in photolysis of water during non-cyclic photophosphorylation. • One of the component of nitrogenase enzyme required for nitrogen metabolism. Zinc • It is absorbed in the form of zinc ions (Zn 2+ ). • Required for chlorophyll formation. • Involved in activation of various enzymes such as carboxylases. • Needed for carbohydrate formation. Copper 3 ","• It is absorbed by the plants in the form of cupric ions (Cu 2+ ). • It is involved in redox reactions during metabolic reactions. • Works during photosynthesis and reproductive stages of the plants. • Involved in flavor of fruits and vegetables. • Increase the sugar content of the plants. Boron • It is absorbed by the plants in the form of BO 3 3− or B 4 O 7 2-. • Involved in the uptake of calcium by the plants. • Functions in pollen tube formation. • Carbohydrate translocation in plants. • Involved in cell differentiation. Molybdenum • Plants obtain it in the form of molybdate ions (MoO 2 ) 2-. • Major component of nitrogenase enzyme. It forms a catalytic site of the enzyme along with iron. • It is an important component of nitrate reductase. Nitrate reductase is an enzyme involved in nitrogen assimilation. • Takes part in nodule formation Chlorine • Absorbed as chloride ions (Cl 1-). • Maintains the osmotic potential of the cell. • It is involved in photolysis of water for evolution of oxygen Deficiency Symptoms of Essential Elements • Nitrogen is one of the important essential elements. Deficiency of nitrogen leads to yellowing of leaves. • Phosphorus is another element of which deficiency will lead to burnt leaf tips and yellowing of the tips. • Potassium deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis and older leaves to wilt. • Calcium deficiency leads to blossom end rot. • Magnesium causes older leaves to become yellow, that is, chlorosis of leaf due to degradation of chlorophyll. 4 ","• Sulphur deficiency leads to yellowing of younger leaves compared to older leaves. • Iron deficiency causes chlorosis of young leaves. Dieback disease is the characteristic disease of deficiency of iron in plants. • Manganese causes yellowing in between the veins of the leaves and reduce plant parts with dead spots. • Zinc causes rosette formation, yellowing between the veins as well as stunted growth of the plant. • Copper is another mineral element, deficiency of which cause weakening of cell wall, dieback of stems and twigs. • Boron affects the reproductive as well as vegetative growth of the plants and, death of the meristem. • Molybdenum causes stunted growth. Leaves appear pale and there is necrosis in the tissues. • Chlorine causes wilting, chlorosis, and highly branched root system. Metabolism of nitrogen Nitrogen exists as two nitrogen atoms joined by a triple covalent bond (N ≡ N). The process of conversion of nitrogen into ammonia is known as nitrogen fixation. There are two methods for the conversion of nitrogen into ammonia. They are as follows- • Physical nitrogen fixation occurs at the time of lightning. N 2 and O 2 present in the atmosphere reacts in presence of lightning to form nitric oxide (NO). NO then further gets oxidized to form nitrogen peroxide (NO 2 ). Formation of ammonia by the decomposition of dead plants and animals is known as ammonification . The process of conversion of ammonia in nitrite and then into nitrate is known as nitrification . The formation of nitrite occurs in presence of Nitrosomonas bacteria whereas nitrate formation occurs in presence of Nitrobacter . Fig.14. Steps of physical nitrogen fixation 5 ","• Biological nitrogen fixation occurs in presence of nitrogen fixing bacteria such as Rhizobium . The prokaryotes that fixes nitrogen biologically are known as diazotrophs . Rhizobium lives in symbiotic association with the roots of the leguminous plants. The enzyme that fixes nitrogen biologically is known as nitrogenase. Nitrogen fixing bacteria can be free living as well as symbiotic. Examples of free-living nitrogen-fixing aerobic microbes are Azotobacter, Rhodospirillum , Anabaena and Nostoc etc. Rhizobium lives in symbiotic association with the leguminous plants such as pea, beans, clover, alfalfa, etc. Nitrogen fixation involves characteristic nodule formation. Nodule formation begins with the interaction of Rhizobium with the roots of the plants. These plants release certain chemicals that attract the bacteria towards the roots of the plants. The Rhizobium secrets root hair curling factor that helps the bacteria to further invade the roots. Nitrogenase enzyme that catalyses nitrogen fixation is sensitive to oxygen. Oxygen is therefore scavenged by the enzyme leghemoglobin (belonging to hemoglobin family) during nitrogen fixation. Fig.14. Steps of nodule formation during biological nitrogen fixation The reaction catalyzed by the nitrogenase is as follows- 6 ","Fig.15. Nitrogenase reaction during biological nitrogen fixation Nitrogen fixation is an energy intensive process. 16 ATP molecules are required to convert one molecule of nitrogen into two molecules of ammonia. The ammonia formed as a result of nitrogen fixation is toxic to the plants. Thus, this ammonia undergoes further reactions- • Reductive amination : The process in which ammonia reacts with alpha-ketoglutaric acid and forms glutamic acid or glutamate as shown below- Fig.16. Reductive amination and Transamination • Transamination: The transfer of amino group from one amino acid to keto acid. This reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as transaminases. This forms asparagine amino acids. Thus, toxic ammonia is converted into amino acids that are essential for the plant growth and development. 7 ","8 ","PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN HIGHER PLANTS The process of synthesis of organic food (carbohydrates) from CO2 and water in the presence of sunlight is called photosynthesis. All green plants have the capacity to make food by photosynthesis. It is the most important synthetic process on earth because it is the only source of carbohydrates in which solar energy is fixed in the form of chemical energy. During photosynthesis, the kinetic energy (light energy) of sunlight is transformed into chemical energy and stored in carbohydrate molecules. This chemical energy is used for the growth and sustenance of our biosphere. All animals including human beings depend on plants for their food. 13.1 What do we know: Photosynthesis is the natural physic-chemical process of the world on which the existence of life on earth depends. This photosynthesis is the single most important biological process required for human existence. Chlorophyll, Light and CO2 are required for photosynthesis. The experiments to prove these are given below. 1. Variegated leaf experiment : A variegated leaf is exposed to sunlight. The leaf is then tested for starch. On testing it is clear that white patches appear as colourless because, they do not contain chlorophyll. From this, we assume that chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis. 2. Light screen experiment : Light screen experiment is used to show that light is essential for photosynthesis. A starved potted plant is taken. A Ganong’s light screen or a black paper is attached to one of its leaves. Ganong’s light screen is a device which allows circulation of air freely, bit allows light to pass only through a limited area. The plant is now exposed to sunlight for a few hours. The leaf is then removed and tested for starch. It is seen that the area containing starch turned blue while the area without starch remains colourless. Further only the portion of the leaf that was exposed to sunlight turned blue. The part of the leaf which is exposed to sunlight synthesized carbohydrate. The covered portion that was cut off from sunlight did not produce carbohydrate. From this we assume that sunlight is necessary for photosynthesis. 1 ","3. Mohl’s experiment : Mohl’s experiment is used to show that CO2 is essential for photosynthesis. Half part of a starved leaf is passed through a split cork and then introduced into a bottle containing some KOH soaked cotton. The other half is exposed to air. The petiole of the leaf is dipped in water contained in a dish. The set up is kept in sunlight for a period and then tested for starch. It can be seen that starch is formed only in the part of the leaf outside the bottle while the portion of the leaf inside the bottle does not show the presence of starch. The part of the leaf which is outside the bottle gets all the requirements for photosynthesis. Since KOH absorbs CO2, no starch is formed in the part of the leaf inside the bottle. This shows that CO2 is necessary for photosynthesis. 13.2 Early experiments : Joseph Priestly in 1774 showed that plants have the ability to take up CO2 from the atmosphere and release O2. He carried out an experiment. He took a bell jar and put a mouse and a burning candle into it. He observed that the air inside had changed. It would not allow the mouse to live in it. Then he placed a mint plant in a vessel of water inside the same bell jar. Now he observed that the mouse lived inside along with the burning candle. He came to the conclusion that the vegetation purified the air which he had been made impure by the burning of candle. From this experiment, Priestly hypothesized that the plants restore to the air whatever breathing animals and burning candles remove. Priestly called the air produced by burning of candles as PHLOGISTON which is noxious for a mouse and said the plants convert it into DEPHLOGISTON. 2 ","Jan Ingenhousz stated that green leaves give out dephlogisticated air ( air rich in oxygen ) in presence of sunlight while in the absence of sunlight ( in dark ) they give out phlogisticated air ( air rich in CO2 ) and make the air impure. Julius von Sachs in 1854 discovered that the green plants synthesize glucose and it is usually stored as starch. T.W Engelmann worked using on Cladophora and Spirogyra . He noted that when light is split using a prism and used to illuminate the algae, the organism aggregate in the blue and red regions Van Neil carried out experiments using green and purple sulphur bacteria. He showed that hydrogen released from suitable oxidisable compound reduces CO2 to carbohydrates also put forth that water is the source of oxygen in photosynthesis. CO 2 + 2H 2 S → (CH 2 O) + H 2 O + 2S The Sulphur gas released was from H2S Van Neil gave a simplified equation of photosynthesis as given below 6CO 2 + 12H 2 O → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O + 6O 2 The oxygen released in the above equation is from H2O and not from CO2. 3 ","13.3: Where does photosynthesis take place? In higher plants chloroplast is semiautonomous, endosymbiont with three membrane system. It is made up of three main parts: Envelope, Matrix and Thylakoid . Envelope: It is made up of outer membrane – porins, inner membrane, in between outer and inner membrane is the periplastidal space. Semi fluid matrix known as stroma, which contain double stranded circular DNA, 70 S ribosome, Carboxylation enzyme RUBISCO, and PEPcarboxylase enzyme Mg, Cl, Mn etc. Thylakoid is membrane lined flattened sac like structure unite to form Grana. Each thylakoid in grana is known as grana thylakoid, inside it contains the lumen for photolysis of water with the help of Mg, Mn, Cl, Ca and number of electron carriers. Each grana interconnected with stroma lamellae. Inside it contains space known as fret channel. Thylakoid membrane possesses 200 to 400 pigment molecule associated with certain protein known as CAB together known as quantosomes or light harvesting complex . Thylakoid membrane also possess F0-F1 particle or coupling factor and number of electron carriers arranged based on their redox potential. 13.4 How many pigments are involved in Photosynthesis? Photosynthetic unit/ PSU/LHC/Quantosome: Quantosomes are considered as the unit of photosynthesis and identified by Roderic B Park. They consist of lipids and proteins and are found in thylakoid membrane of chloroplast. It is the smallest group of pigment molecules which takes part in conversion of solar energy into chemical energy. It has a photocentre/trap centre/reaction centre which is always a single chlorophyll a molecule which is fed by light harvesting pigments. They are • Core molecule-20-30 chlorophyll a molecule around the reaction centre. • Antennae molecule which absorbs light of shorter wave length. When they absorb light, they get excited and it gives energy to the core, then to the reaction centre by electron spin resonance. There are two photo systems-PS I and PS II. LHC are made up of hundreds of pigment molecules bound to protein. Each PS has all the pigment molecules bound to proteins. Each PS has all the pigments except one molecule of chlorophyll a forming LH system also called antenna. 4 ","Single chlorophyll act as reaction centre which is different in both photo systems. In PS I reaction centre is P700 but in PS II is P680. Light Harvesting Complex: 200-400 pigments + protein (CAB) RC + Core molecule + Antenna + protein Core molecules are PS I and PS II Photosynthetic Pigments : There are three main types of photosynthetic pigments- • Chlorophylls • Carotenoids • Phycobillins. Chlorophyll: Term coined by Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaimé Caventou . They are green in colour, water soluble pigment of different types. • Chlorophyll a: 5 ","Universal pigment Present in all photosynthetic organisms except photosynthetic bacteria. The photosynthetic pigment and accessory pigments absorb light of different wavelength. This energy is transferred to chlorophyll a through electron spin resonance. They are bluish green in colour. Dissolves in petroleum ether. Molecular formula is C 55 H 72 O 5 N 4 Mg • Chlorophyll b: In all higher plants. Olive green in colour. Molecular formula is C 55 H 70 O 6 N 4 Mg Dissolves in 90% methyl alcohol. Chlorophyll a is more than chlorophyll b. • Chlorophyll c : Present in diatom, dino-flagellates and brown algae. Chemical formula is C 35 H 32 O 5 N 4 Mg • Chlorophyll d: Molecular formula is C 54 H 70 MgO 6 N 4 Chlorophyll has a tadpole like configuration with a head porphyrin made up of 4 pyrrole ring together known as tetrapyrole. A non ionic Mg is held at the centre with 2 covalent and 2 coordination bond. In chlorophyll a, 3 rd Carbon of second pyrrole ring is methyl group but in chlorophyll b, methyl group is replaced by CHO group. Phytol tail with C 20 H 39 OH. Insoluble in water as phytol side chain is composed of insoluble Carbon and Hydrogen atoms, hence to anchor the chlorophyll molecule with thylakoid in chloroplast. Chlorophyll requires light for synthesis and raw materials are glycine and succinyl coenzyme A. • Chlorophyll e It is rare. 6 ","Yellow in colour. Seen in Vaucheria . • Bacteriochlorophyll: Seen in bacteria. Molecular formula is C 55 H 74 O 6 N 4 Mg . It is very similar to chlorophyll a except for the presence of acetyl group instead of vinyl at the second carbon position of the tetrapyrrole ring. • Chlorobium chlorophyll : Also known as Bacteriovirdin. It has hydroxyl methyl group at the second carbon position in the tetrapyrrole nucleus. Molecular formula is C 51 H 67 O 64 N 4 Mg . • 2.Carotenoids: Protect chlorophyll from photooxidation.So known as shield pigments. They are yellow orange pigments, Water insoluble accessory pigment. No light is required for their formation. Absorb blue and violet light. Commonly are tetraterpenes . Carotenoids are of two types-carotenes and xanthophylls. Carotenes: They are reduced molecules. Have the general formula C 40 H 56 . Carotenes are of three types Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Alpha carotene is present in all plants. Beta carotene is the abundant precursor of Vitamin A Gamma carotene in green sulphur bacteria. Lycopene: Red pigment in tomato and chilly. Xanthophyll: Yellow brown pigment and are oxygen containing derivative of carotene. 7 ","Abundant in Viola . Fucoxanthin in brown algae. Phycobillins: These are photosynthetic pigments of some algal group structurally related to bile pigments and there are open tetrapyrrole with neither Mg nor phytol. Only water soluble pigment. 3 Types: Phycoerythrin, Phycocyanin, and allophycocyanin. These are important accessory pigments in blue green algae and red algae. They are also called biliproteins. Absorption spectrum : The chloroplast pigments are responsible for the absorption of light. A particular pigment absorbs light rays with different wavelengths. For example: chlorophyll a absorbs blue and red lights in the visible spectrum. The amount of light absorbed by a pigment can be plotted. The graphic representation of the absorption spectrum (peak) against wavelength is called absorption spectrum. Action spectrum : Photosynthesis takes place in visible light ranging from 400nm to 700nm wave length. It does not take place at the same rate with other wave lengths. The rate of photosynthesis at different wavelengths is measured and plotted by the amount of action. (i.e., oxygen evolution, carbon dioxide utilization). This graphic representation of rate of photosynthesis against wave length is called action spectrum. 8 ","13.5 What is light reaction? In 1882, T.W.Engelmann plotted the first action spectrum of photosynthesis using green algae, Cladophora . The maximum rate of photosynthesis occurs with red light of the visible spectrum. Most of the photosynthesis takes place in the blue and red regions of the visible spectrum. Photosynthesis does not take place at the same rate at the other wavelengths of the spectrum. This happens because, the accessory pigments have only the capacity to absorb light energy and transfer it to chlorophyll a. The light reaction takes place only in the chlorophyll a (reaction centre). Mechanism of photosynthesis: Photosynthesis is an oxidation-reduction reaction in which water is oxidized and carbon dioxide is reduced. The general equation that represents photosynthesis may be written as 6CO 2 + 12H 2 O → C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6 H 2 O + 6O 2 The end products of photosynthesis are carbohydrate, water, and oxygen. Carbon dioxide and water are the raw materials for photosynthesis. Oxygen is liberated into the atmosphere as a byproduct during this process. This evolved oxygen comes from water and not from carbon dioxide. In photosynthetic plants the hydrogen donor is water and the source of oxygen released is also water. In 1932, Robert Emerson and Arnold proposed that the whole process of photosynthesis involves two distinct phases. They are photochemical phase and biosynthetic phase. Photochemical phase or Light Reaction: It is the light dependent phase of photosynthesis in which ATP and NADPH are formed in the presence of light. 9 ","It takes place in the grana of the chloroplast. It takes place in the presence of sunlight. It consist of the following steps: a. Light absorption b. Water splitting c. Oxygen release d. Formation of high energy chemical intermediates (ATP and NADPH). In 1935, Robert Emerson proved that two pigment systems are involved in light reaction. They are pigment system I (photo system I and P.S.I) and pigment system II or P.S.II). The reaction centre and the light harvesting system (accessory pigments) together form photosystem or pigment system. About 250 to 450 pigment molecules constitute a single photosystem. Photosystems are functional and structural units consisting of protein complexes involved in photosynthesis. They are located in the thylakoid membranes of plants and algae or in the cytoplasmic membrane of photosynthetic bacteria. Two kinds of photosystems are present-Photosystem I and Photosystem II. Both photosystems are required for oxygenic photosynthesis. The photosystem II is located in the appressed region of granal thylakoids. PS I is found in the non-appressed region of grana and stroma thylakoids. 13.6 The Electron Transport: Noncyclic photophosphorylation: It is also termed as Z scheme. Both PS I and PS II are involved . PS II consists of Chlorophyll a 660, Chlorophyll a 673, Chlorophyll a 690, Chlorophyll b, Chlorophyll c, or Chlorophyll d, carotenoids, and phycobillins. Chlorophyll a 680 is the reaction centre. It occurs in stroma lamellae. The electron do not go back to the reaction centre but rather are accepted by NADP+. Photolysis of water uses up the electrons and leads to the formation of ATP and NADPH2 . The steps in the process begin with the PS II. 10 ","Electrons are passed to plastoquinone reducing substance (PQRS) . PQRS passes them to plastoquinone which passes them to the cytochrome system. The cytochrome system passes them to plastocyanin which in turn passes them to PS I. The steps afterwards include FRS, Ferredoxin, and NADP reductase. 13.6.1 Photolysis of water: P680 becomes a strong oxidizing agent and splits a molecule of water to release oxygen. This light dependent splitting of water molecule is called photolysis of water. Manganese, Calcium and chloride ions play important roles in the photolysis of water. The photolysis of water in photosynthesis was first demonstrated by Robert Hill in 1937. Water is splitting into hydrogen ions, oxygen and electrons. Oxygen is one of the end products of photosynthesis. 13.6.2 Cyclic photophosphorylation and noncyclic photophosphorylation: Also known as Light reaction/Hill reaction/Photochemical reaction/ Generation of assimilatory powers/Photophase. In cyclic photophosphorylation only PSI works. PS I consists of Chlorophyll a 670, Chlorophyll a 683, Chlorophyll a 695, carotenoids, some molecules of chlorophyll b and reaction centre a 700 or P 700. This form of photophosphorylation occurs on the thylakoid membrane. The electron begins PS I, passes from the primary acceptor to ferredoxin reducing substance (FRS), Then to ferredoxin, then to cytochrome b6f and then to plastocyanin before returning to PS I. 11 ","This process produces a proton motive force, pumping H + ions across the membrane thereby generating a concentration gradient that can be used to power ATP synthase during chemiosmosis. Cyclic photophosphorylation neither produces O2 nor NADPH. NADP+ does not accept the electrons, they are instead sent back to cytochrome b6f complex. This process is mostly seen in bacteria and favoured in anaerobic condition. 13.6.3 Chemiosmotic hypothesis: ATP synthesis in the chloroplast is explained by chemiosmotic hypothesis. It was proposed by Peter Mitchell in 1961. According to chemiosmotic hypothesis, during photosynthesis, a proton gradient is developed across the thylakoid membrane. Protons are accumulated towards the inside of the thylakoid membrane in the thylakoid lumen. The proton gradient is caused by 3 ways: 1. Water molecule is broken up into H + and OH − on the inner side of the thylakoid membrane. As a result H + are accumulated within the thylakoid lumen. 2. When the electron move through the photosystem I and photosystem II, H+ are transported across the thylakoid membrane. Primary electron acceptor is located towards the outer side of the thylakoid membrane. This primary electron acceptor transfers its electron to an H carrier and not to an electron carrier directly. 12 ","This hydrogen carrier molecule transfers the electron to the electron carrier (cytochrome b, cytochrome f etc.) on the inner side of the thylakoid membrane and removes a H + ion from the stroma while transporting an electron. This proton is released into the inner side of the thylakoid membrane. 3. NADP reductase enzyme is located on the stroma side of the thylakoid membrane. When electrons come from the electron acceptor of PS I, H + are necessary for the reduction of NADP + to NADPH + H + . These H + are removed from the stroma. By these ways within the chloroplast, H + are accumulated in the thylakoid lumen and are decreased in number in stroma. This creates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. As a result, pH is decreased in the thylakoid lumen. The proton gradient is broken when the protons move to the stroma through the transmembrane channel of the F0 of the ATPase enzyme across the thylakoid membrane. ATPase enzyme has two parts. The base of the ATPase is called F0 and head piece is called F1, F0 forms a transmembrane channel which is embedded in the thylakoid membrane on the side that faces the stroma. Chemiosmosis requires a membrane, a proton pump, a proton gradient and ATPase enzyme. The channel of the F0 of the ATPase allows the diffusion of H + back across the thylakoid membrane. As a result, enough energy is released. This energy activates ATPase. ATPase catalyses ATP synthesis from ADP. This ATP is used immediately in the dark reaction taking place in the stroma. As a result, sugar synthesis takes place by CO2 fixation. 13 ","13.7 Where are ATP and NADPH used? Biosynthetic Phase: Alternative names are Calvin cycle, C3 cycle, Photosynthetic Carbon Reduction cycle, and Reductive pentose pathway. C3 cycle comes under dark reaction, as no direct light is required for the process to be carried out. Calvin presented these reactions in a cyclic manner and it is thus called Calvin cycle. A three carbon compound called Phosphoglyceric acid (PGA) is the first stable compound produced during Calvin cycle. Hence this cycle is also called as C3 cycle. Calvin used Chlorella pyrenoidosa as the experimental organism. Chlorella is a unicellular green alga. This alga contains cup shaped chloroplast which performs photosynthesis similar to the higher plants. He used radioactive carbon dioxide containing radioactive isotope of carbon ( 14 C).He also used chromatography and autoradiography in his experiment. ATP and NADPH produced during light reaction in the grana of the chloroplast are the essential requirements for the assimilation of CO 2 to carbohydrates. All the necessary enzymes of CO 2 assimilation are localized in the stroma. C3 pathway or dark reaction takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast . 13.7.1 The Primary Acceptor of CO2: The primary CO2 acceptor is the 5 carbon compound RuBP. 13.7.2 The Calvin Cycle: Calvin cycle is divided into 3 distinct stages. • Carboxylation 14 ","• Reduction • Regeneration. 1. Carboxylation-During which CO 2 combines with RuBP. 2. Reduction- During which carbohydrate is formed at the expense of the photo chemically made ATP and NADPH. 3. Regeneration- During which the CO 2 acceptor (RuBP) is formed again so that the cycle continues. Carboxylation: The CO 2 fixation into a stable intermediate is called carboxylation. The 5 carbon compound Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) present accept CO 2 . 6 Molecules of RuBP combines with 6 molecules of CO2 to produce 6 molecules of 6 carbon compound. Carbon compound formed are unstable. These 6 molecules of 6 carbon compound are immediately broken down into 12 molecules of 3 phosphoglyceric acid (PGA) in the presence of water. The PGA is a 3 carbon compound and it is the first stable compound produced during photosynthesis. The carboxylation reaction is catalysed by an enzyme called RuBisCo (RuBP carboxylase) . RuBisCo also possesses oxygenation activity and hence abbreviated as RuBisCo (RuBP carboxylase-oxygenase). The oxygenation activity of the enzyme allows to compete with CO2 for combining with RuBP (Photorespiration). Reduction : The process of addition of Hydrogen is called reduction. PGA is reduced into glyceraldehydes phosphate by utilizing assimilatory powers, ATP and NADPH produced in light reaction. Hydrogen from NADPH is added in this reaction. PGAL is a 3 carbon sugar (triose sugar). The ADP and NADP + regenerated are used again for further light reaction. This step is obviously a reversal of reaction steps of glycolysis. In this case, the reducing power is obtained from NADPH rather than NADH. The 3 carbon molecule (PGAL) formed in the reduction reaction of Calvin cycle are also called triose phosphates. These triose phosphates (PGAL) act as precursors for the synthesis of sucrose and starch. Regeneration: Of the 12 molecules of glyceraldehydes phosphate (PGAL) formed in the reduction stage, 10 molecules are obtained with 6 ATP molecules through a complex series of reactions regenerate Ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). The intermediate compounds such as Erythrose mono phosphate, Xylulose mono phosphate, Sedoheptulose mono phosphate, Ribose mono phosphate and Ribulose mono phosphate are produced in this reaction. The 6ATP used here also formed from the photochemical reactions. The regenerated RuBP is used to accept CO2 again. For every 6 molecules of CO2 that enters the Calvin cycle, the net output is 2 molecules of PGAL. 6 turns of Calvin cycle are required to produce one molecule of glucose. 6RUBP + 6C0 2 + 18ATP + 12NADPH2 — -————— > 6RUBP + C 6 H 12 O 6 + 18ADP + 18Pi + 12NADP + 6H 2 0. 15 ","The C3 cycle requires 18 ATP for the synthesis of one molecule of glucose. But of the 18 ATP, 6ATP molecules are used in the regeneration of RuBP after the formation of one molecule of glucose. In the Calvin cycle, ADP and NADP + required for light reaction are regenerated. 13.8 The C4 Pathway: Also known as Hatch and Slack Pathway or Di carboxylic acid cycle or CO 2 concentration mechanism. Kortschak and Hatch first observed that 4C, Oxalo Acetic Acid (OAA) is formed in sugarcane leaves during dark reaction. A pathway for dark reactions in sugarcane and maize leaves was proposed by Hatch and Slack . It is the CO 2 fixation in tropical plants like Maize, Sugarcane, Sorghum, Pearl millet, Amaranthus, etc. Hatch and Slack reported that first formed acid is a 4 carbon compound called Oxaloacetic acid. It showed a special leaf anatomy called Kranz anatomy. Green bundle sheath cells present around the vascular bundles. Two types of chloroplast (dimorphism) are present in the leaf cells. In mesophyll cells, chloroplasts are small and with grana while chloroplast of bundle sheath cells are larger without grana . PEPCase (Phospho enol pyruvate carboxylase) enzyme is present in the mesophyll cells while RuBisCo present in the bundle sheath cells. In the C4 plants, C3 cycle occurs in bundle sheath cells, while C4 cycle occurs in mesophyll cells. CO 2 acceptor in C4 is phosphoenolpyruvate which is a 3 carbon compound. First carboxylation in C4 cycle is catalysed by PEPCase in the cytoplasm of mesophyll cells. The second or final carboxylation takes place in bundle sheath cells through the C3 cycle. 16 ","30 ATP molecules are needed for the production of one glucose molecule in C4 plants. The enzyme pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) converts pyruvate to PEP by converting an ATP to AMP. This regeneration of PEP helps C4 plants to increase the efficiency of CO2 fixation. The pathway begins with the conversion of pyruvate into phosphoenol pyruvate by the enzyme pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase. Then the fixation of CO2 into oxaloacetate by the enzyme PEP carboxylase. Both these reactions takes place in the mesophyll cells. OAA is converted into malate which is transported into the bundle sheath cells. Decarboxylation of Malate produce CO2 and pyruvate. The CO2 now enters the Calvin cycle and pyruvate is transported into the mesophyll cells. Advantages - No photorespiration, more efficient in picking CO 2 because PEP have more affinity to CO 2 . Effect of water stress is minimized in C4 plants. As bundle sheath cells lie close to the surface of water supply. Tolerate stress because of organic acids. C4 plants have strategies for minimizing water loss for fixation of same amount of CO 2 . C4 plants are twice efficient as C3 plants for the same amount of CO2 fixation. CAM pathway or Crassulacean acid metabolism or Dark acidification: First reported in Bryophyllum a member of Crassulaceae. CAM is a kind of adaptation in succulents like Opuntia , Agave, Pine apple, Sedum, Kalanchoe, Kleinia etc. 17 ","Phosphoenol pyruvate is the primary acceptor of CO 2 and oxalo acetic acid is the first product. In CAM plants stomata are of scotoactive type (open at night). Organic acids are produced during night and they are broken down during the day and final CO 2 fixation occurs during the day time. PEPCase induces carboxylation during night. PEP carboxylase and RuBisCo are present in the mesophyll cells. 30ATP needed for the synthesis of 1 molecule of glucose and no kranz anatmy is seen. The CAM plants leave the stomata closed during the day time and highly reduces the water loss during the day time. 13.9 Photorespiration: Also known as photosynthetic carbon oxidation cycle or C2 cycle or Glycolate metabolism. It is the light dependent utilization of oxygen and reduce CO 2 by photosynthetic organs. It occurs at high temperature and high Oxygen. Under this condition the affinity of RuBP towards oxygen increases and CO 2 decreases. Photorespiration does not produce energy and it may reduce photosynthesis by up to 50%. But in C4 plants it is overcome by Kranz anatomy. 18 ","Here instead of PGA, phosphoglycolate (PA) is produced and is recycled to produce PGA through photorespiratory pathway. It occurs in chloroplast, Peroxisomes and mitochondria. 13.10 Factors affecting photosynthesis: External factors: • Availability of sunlight, • CO2 concentration • Temperature • Water. F.F Blackman proposed the law of limiting factor in 1905. It states that if a chemical process is affected by more than one factor, then its rate will be determined by the factor which is nearest to its minimal value: it is the factor which directly affects the process if its quantity is changed. Among all the factors of a biochemical process, the slowest or the smallest factor affects the total rate of the process. This smallest factor is called the limiting factor. 13.10.1 Light: There is a linear relationship between light intensity and rate of photosynthesis at low light intensity. At extreme light photo oxidation of chlorophyll molecules takes place which decreases the rate of photosynthesis. The intensity of light at which the rate of photosynthesis becomes equal to the rate of respiration is called the compensation point. Beyond saturation, photosynthesis declines due to solarisation. 19 ","Chloroplast align parallel to the cell wall for absorbing maximum light and align to the cell wall for absorbing minimum light. Light intensity, light quality and duration of exposure of light influence photosynthesis. Light between the wave length of 400-700nm in the visible spectrum is the most effective for photosynthesis. This light is called photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The rate of photosynthesis increases with the increase in the light intensity. At higher light intensity the rate of photosynthesis decreases. Light quality -The maximum rate of photosynthesis is in red light. The rate of photosynthesis in plants growing under canopy will be decreased since green light is inert for photosynthesis. Longer duration of exposure to light period helps photosynthesis. If the plants get 10 to 12 hours of light per day it helps the plants to carry out photosynthesis more efficiently. 13.10.2 Carbon dioxide concentration -It is the major limiting factor. The percentage of CO 2 in atmosphere is 0.03% and in water is 0.3%. So algae are more productive. Photosynthesis in C4 plant is less limited by atmospheric CO 2 because the fixation of CO 2 is mediated through PEPCase. Productivity of C4 plants does not increase when concentration of CO 2 increases because present level of atmospheric CO 2 is not generally a limiting factor for C4 plants. High CO 2 compensation point in C3 plants but in C4 plants it is low. Very high Concentration of CO2 stimulate abscissic acid which leads to the closure of stomata and reduces the CO 2 uptake. Hence the photosynthetic rate is decreased. 13.10.3 Temperature: Dark reaction being enzymatic, it is temperature controlled. Optimum temperature in C3 plants is 20-25 and in C4 30-45 degree centigrade. Enzymes are inactive at high temperature as they get denatured. At low temperature also the enzymes are inactive. 20 ","13.10.4 Water : Less than 1% of the water absorbed by the land plant is utilized for photosynthesis. Availability of water in soil has a prominent effect on plant photosynthesis. If soil water becomes a limiting factor, plants undergo water stress. Under the conditions of water stress, the rate of photosynthesis decreases. Internal factors: 1. The number, size , age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and chloroplast 2. Internal CO 2 concentration 3. The amount of chlorophyll are the important internal factors which affect the rate of photosynthesis. The Number, size , age and orientation of leaves, mesophyll cells and chloroplast: As the leaves develop, the capacity of photosynthesis increases and reaches the maximum due to the increase in the metabolic activities of the cells. Then onwards there is a decline in the rate of photosynthesis with age. If leaf turns yellow due to ageing (senescence), loss of chlorophyll occurs.  In aged leaf the enzymes become inactivated which affect the rate of photosynthesis. Generally leaves are either arranged vertically or at right angle to sunlight. In shade plants, leaves are arranged horizontally to receive maximum sunlight. Internal CO 2 concentration : Increase in the rate of CO 2 uptake increases the internal CO 2 concentration in both C3 and C4 species. High light intensity induces the opening of stoma. When stoma opens CO 2 uptake increases. Increase in diffusion of CO 2 into the leaf increases the internal CO 2 concentration. This increase in internal CO 2 increases the rate of photosynthesis in both C3 plants and C4 plants. C4 plants have developed a system of concentrating CO 2 in their bundle sheath cells. Amount of chlorophyll : Chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis. The chlorophyll content of the leaves never becomes a limiting factor in photosynthesis. For example, the sun plants contain less chlorophyll in their leaves than those of shade plants. But the sun plants show a high rate of photosynthesis in bright light than the shade plants. Fast Revision Track: The process by which green plants prepare their food using solar energy is called photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is the main photosynthetic pigments. Carotenoids are the coloured pigments. Quantosomes are the unit of photosynthesis. Absorption spectrum is the graph obtained by plotting absorption vs wavelength for a particular pigment. Action spectrum is the graph plotted showing the effectiveness of wavelength of light in stimulating the process. 21 ","Photosystems are the functional and structural units consisting of protein complexes involved in photosynthesis. They are located on the thylakoid membranes Two types of photosystem-PS1 and PS II C3 cycle in normal plants C4 cycle is plants with Kranz anatomy. CAM pathway in plants whose stomata opens during night. Photorespiration is a waste in plants as no glucose or ATP or NADPH produced. Photorespiration is the pathway to recycle phosphoglycolate. Light, CO2 concentration, Temperature, Water, leaf anatomy, Chlorophyll etc are the factors affecting photosynthesis. 22 ","RESPIRATION IN PLANTS Respiration is the process in which complex organisms are combined with oxygen and are broken down to simpler substances with consequent release of energy and production of carbon dioxide and water. The term respiration was coined by Dutrochet. The breaking down of C-C bond of complex molecules by oxidation leading to the release of a lot of energy is called cellular respiration. Respiration is an amphibolic process (catabolic and anabolic process). Many respiratory intermediates are used for the synthesis of many other biomolecules. Acetyl coenzyme A is used for the synthesis of fatty acid and Gibberellic acid. Succinyl coenzyme A is used for the synthesis of chlorophyll, phytochrome and cytochrome. Oxaloacetic acid and alpha ketoglutaric acid is used for the synthesis of amino acids such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid. Organic substances are oxidized during respiration and are called respiratory substrates. Classification of cellular respiration on the basis of types of substrates involved and are of two types 1. Floating respiration-Fat or carbohydrates are used as substrates and it is the common type. 2. Protoplasmic respiration- Proteins are used as substrates and occur in starved condition. 14.1 Do plants breathe? Plants breathe and they require oxygen for respiration and gives our CO2. Plants don’t have any special system for breathing or gaseous exchange. Stomata and lenticels allow gaseous exchange by diffusion. Only a very little transport of gases takes place from one part to another in plants. Plants do not present great demands for gas exchange. During photosynthesis, large volumes of gases are exchanged. Availability of oxygen is not a problem because oxygen is released within the cell during photosynthesis. About 50% of the total energy released during respiration may be used for the synthesis of bio molecules and for other life activities. The carbon skeleton produced during respiration is used as a precursor for the biosynthesis of other cellular molecules. Mitochondrion is the respiratory apparatus or site of respiration. Types of respiration- On the basis of availability of oxygen cellular respiration are divided into two types-Aerobic and anaerobic respiration. Salt respiration is the increased respiration taking place during active absorption in plants. Climatic respiration takes place during ripening of fruits. E.g.: Apple, Mango etc. Aerobic respiration: The complete oxidation of food materials in the presence of oxygen and the formation of CO2 and Water as end products. The equation for aerobic respiration is C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O+ 2870kJ It takes place in mitochondria and 2870kJ of energy is released. 1 ","The two main stages of aerobic respiration are glycolysis and citric acid cycle. First discovered by Kollicker in striated muscles of insects. C.Benda coined the term Mitochondrion. Hoyeboom proposed that mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration. Mitochondria are a semiautonomous organelle due to the presence of circular DNA, RNA and ribosomes. They live inside the eukaryotic cell with symbiotic relationship (endosymbiont). 14.2 Glycolysis: Glycolysis is the first phase of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration. It is the oxidation of glucose into pyruvic acid through a series of enzyme catalysed reactions. The various steps were discovered by Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof and J.Paranas. So is also called as EMP pathway. Glucose undergoes partial oxidation to form 2 molecules of pyruvic acid . Glycolysis consists of two major phases. • Preparatory phase and cleavage • Oxidative and payoff phase. The steps involved in both these phases are as follows. Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6 phosphate in the presence of ATP and hexokinase. Glucose 6 phosphate is converted into its isomeric form called fructose 6 phosphate by the enzyme phosphorgluco isomerase. Subsequent steps of metabolism of glucose and fructose are the same. Fructose 6 phosphate is phosphorylated with the help of one ATP molecule to form fructose 1,6 biphosphate. Fructose 1,6 biphosphate is then broken down into 2 molecules of triose phosphate (3 carbon compound) such as glyceraldehyde phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate catalysed by the enzyme aldolase. Both are interconvertible. 2 ","Dihydroxy acetone phosphate is isomerised into glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate. Thus totally 2 molecules of Gleceraldehyde 3 phosphate are formed. Each glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate molecule is then converted into a triose phosphate called 1,3 biphosphoglyceric acid by oxidation. During the oxidation, 2 protons and 2 electrons are released. Of these protons and electrons released, one proton and 2 electrons are added to the NAD and it is reduced into NAD+H + . Each 1,3 biphosphoglyceric acid is then converted into a triose phosphate called 3 phospho glyceric acid .During this step an ATP molecule is also released. In this type of ATP generation, a phosphate group of the substrate molecule or metabolite is directly transferred to ADP to form ATP. Such a type of synthesis is called substrate level synthesis of substrate level phosphorylation. It is different from the ATP synthesis in chloroplast (phosphorylation) and in mitochondria (oxidative phosphorylation). Each 3 phosphoglyceric acid is converted into 2 phosphoglycerate. Each 2 phosphoglycerate is changed into 2 phosphoenol pyruvate by releasing one molecule of water. Phosphoenolpyruvate is a good donor for the formation of ATP. Each 2 phosphoenol pyruvate is then converted into pyruvic acid in the presence of an enzyme pyruvate kinase. During this step, an ATP molecule is also released. Here a phosphate group of the substrate or metabolite is directly transferred to ADP to form ATP. So this type of ATP synthesis is also a substrate level ATP synthesis. In EMP pathway the ATP molecules are produced in two ways. • Direct transfer of phosphate to ADP • Oxidation of the NADH+H+ produced during glycolysis to NAD+ During glycolysis, from one molecule of glucose, 2 molecules of pyruvic acid and 4 molecules of ATP are formed. 2 ATP molecules are consumed in the phosphorylation reactions. 2 molecules of NADH+H + , which can subsequently be oxidized to yield 6 molecules of ATP. So the net gain of ATP molecules will be 8 instead of 2. As a result of glycolysis, 2 pyruvic acid molecules and 8 ATP molecules are produced. 3 ","The key product of glycolysis is pyruvic acid (pyruvate) .The metabolic fate of pyruvic acid is in 3 ways depending on the cellular need, availability of oxygen and the organism. 1. Aerobic respiration 2. Alcoholic fermentation 3. Lactic acid fermentation. 14.3 Fermentation: The incomplete oxidation of food materials in the absence of oxygen and the formation of CO2 and ethanol as end products is called anaerobic respiration. It is also called fermentation or zymosis. It is carried out by yeast. Fermentation was discovered by Gay Lussac .The term fermentation was coined by Shank. C6H12O6 → 2 C2H5OH + 2 CO2+210kJ Fermentation also takes place in many prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes and in germinating seeds under anaerobic condition. It is of two types-Alcoholic fermentation and Lactic acid fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation: CO2 and ethyl alcohol (ethanol) are the end products. It has 2 series of steps. First reaction is glycolysis. The end product of glycolysis, pyruvic acid is then converted into CO2 and ethanol. This conversion has 2 steps. 1. Pyruvic acid is converted into acetaldehyde and CO2 in the presence of pyruvic acid dehycarboxylase enzyme. 2. Acetaldehyde is converted into ethanol in the presence of alcoholdehydrogenase enzyme and a coenzyme. The end products are ethanol and CO2. As a result of glycolysis 8 ATP molecules are released. 2 NAADH+H + molecules (1 NADH+H + =3 ATP) are utilized later. So the net gain is 2 ATP molecules in fermentation. In animals anaerobic respiration takes place in skeletal muscles. The skeletal muscles derive energy by anaerobic respiration 4 ","Lactic acid fermentation: The end product is lactic acid. It is used in milk industry also occurs in muscle cells of vertebrates. Lactobacillus bacteria cause curd formation. CO2 is not produced and NADH+H + is converted into NAD + . The reaction is catalysed by lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. Net gain of ATP is 2. 14.4 Aerobic respiration: The end products of glycolysis are a 3 carbon compound called pyruvic acid. It is formed by the glycolytic catabolism of carbohydrates in the cytoplasm or cytosol. The crucial events are • The complete oxidation of pyruvic acid by the stepwise removal of all the hydrogen atoms. 5 ","• The electrons move to the molecular oxygen with simultaneous synthesis of ATP. It takes place on the inner membrane of the mitochondria. • The removal of CO2 molecules. It takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria. After pyruvic acid enters into the mitochondria for citric acid cycle one of the 3 carbon atoms of pyruvic acid is oxidized to CO2.This reaction is called oxidative decarboxylation .In this reaction, pyruvic acid is first decarboxylated and then oxidized by the enzyme, pyruvate dehydrogenase. The remaining part of pyruvic acid combines with Coenzyme A to form acetyl coenzyme A in the presence of Mg 2+. . Co A is a sulphur containing compound. Acetyl Co A is the connecting link between glycolysis and citric acid cycle . The aerobic oxidation of pyruvic acid is called link reaction. During this process NAD+ is reduced to NADH+H + . The 2 pyruvic acid molecules are produced from one molecule of glucose by glycolysis are oxidized during this aerobic oxidation. Thus 2NADH+H+ molecules are formed. As a result there is a net gain of 6 ATP molecules (2NADH+H+=2X 3 =6 ATP). 14.4.1 Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle: TCA cycle is the complete oxidation of pyruvic acid into CO2 and water through a series of reactions in the presence of oxygen and it takes place in the mitochondria. 6 ","The steps were traced by Hans Krebs and so it is also known as Krebs cycle. The first compound formed is tricarboxylic acid – citric acid, so it is also known as Citric acid cycle . It is a tricarboxylic acid as it contains 3 acid groups, so known as tricarboxylic acid cycle. In TCA cycle the respiratory substrate is acetyl coenzymeA. The acceptor molecule is a 4 carbon compound called Oxalo Acetic acid. It involves 4 dehydrogenation (removal of hydrogen) reactions and two decarboxylation (removal of CO2) reactions. In citric acid cycle the coenzymes are reduced and CO2 is evolved. One molecule of acetyl coenzyme A combines with 4 carbon oxaloacetic acid to form a 6 carbon compound, citric acid. This reaction is catalysed by an enzyme citrus synthase. The reaction utilizes one molecule of water and release CoA Citric acid is then isomerised to isocitric acid with a molecule of water. Isocitric acid is converted into oxaloacetic acid by dehydrogenation. Here NAD + is reduced to NADH+H + . Oxalosuccinic acid is then decarboxylated to form a 5 carbon compound alpha ketglutaric acid (5C). Alpha ketoglutaric acid is dexcarboxylated to form a 4 carbon compound to form a 4 carbon compound succinyl Co A by dehydrogenation. NAD + is reduced to NADH+H + . CoA is required in this reaction. Succinyl Co A loses its CoA and reacts with GDP to form succinic acid and GTP. Later GTP transfers its one phosphate to ADP and thus ATP is formed. Succinic acid is converted into fumaric acid (4C) by dehydrogenation reaction. FAD is reduced to FADH 2 . A water molecule is added to fumaric acid to form malic acid. Finally malic acid is converted into oxaloacetic acid by dehydrogenation reaction. NAD + is reduced to NADH+H + . Oxaloacetic acid produced in this reaction becomes available to combine with acetyl CoA to start a new cycle. The oxidation of acetyl Co A through citric acid cycle requires the continued replenishment of oxaloacetic acid and it requires the regeneration of NAD + and FAD + from NADH+H + and FADH 2 respectively. Since 2 pyruvic acid molecules are formed from one molecule of glucose by glycolysis, 2 molecules of acetyl CoA are also formed. 7 ","During aerobic oxidation of pyruvic acid to acetyl Co A, 2 NADH+H + are formed. In one citric acid cycle 3 NADH+H + , 1 FADH 2 and 1ATP are formed. Subsequently each NADH+H + is oxidized aerobically to yield 3 ATP molecules, each FADH 2 is oxidized to yield 2 ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. So the net gain of ATP molecules in each citric acid cycle is 12 ATP. There is a net gain of 38 ATP molecules during aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose. In most eukaryotic cells, for transporting the NADH produced in glycolysis into mitochondria for further oxidation, 2 ATP molecules are required. Hence net gain of ATP is 36 molecules. Thus 45% of energy released during the oxidation of 1 molecule of glucose is stored in 38 ATP molecules. Rest of the energy generated during aerobic respiration is lost in the form of heat. 8 ","14.4.2 Electron transport system and Oxidative phosphorylation : During aerobic respiration, hydrogen ions and electrons are removed from respiratory substrates such as glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate, pyruvic acid, isocitric acid, alpha ketoglutaric acid, succinic acid, and malic acid by dehydrogenation reaction. The removal of electrons means that energy is removed. These hydrogen ions and electrons are now fused with coenzymes such as NAD + and FAD. As a result, NAADH+H + or FADH 2 is formed. The energy of the electrons is stored in the form of chemical energy in bonds between NADH and H and FAD and H. During oxidation of NADH and FADH 2 , the electrons of the hydrogen atoms are transported to the oxygen through different kinds of electron carriers which are arranged in a specific order called electron transport chain or mitochondrial respiratory chain or electron transport system. The electron transport system is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The individual members of the ETS are called electron carriers . They are Flavin, FeS protein, quinines, and cytochromes . Flavin is FMN (Flavin mononucleotide). FeS is an iron sulphur protein. Quinones are mobile electron carriers in the membrane. The common quinine is ubiquinone. Ubiquinone is a phenolic compound. Cytochromes are enzymes as well as electron carriers. Cytochromes involved in ETS are Cyt b, Cyt c1, Cyt c, Cyt a, and Cyt a3 . All these cytochromes contain iron as activator. Cyt a3 additionally contains copper . For each dehydrogenation reaction during aerobic respiration, NADH+H + is formed in the mitochondrial matrix. On oxidation, NADH+H + donates 2 hydrogen atoms to FMN seen in the inner mitochondrial membrane and FMN becomes FMNH 2 . It takes place in the presence of NADH dehydrogenase enzyme. Then FMNH 2 breaks up and release protons into the inter membrane space and 2 electrons to FeS in the inner mitochondrial space. From FeS, the electrons are picked up by ubiquinone (UQ) of the enzyme. UQ also picks 2 protons from the matrix to form UQH 2 . Some times UQ picks up 2 protons directly from FADH 2 . During the citric acid cycle, FADH 2 is formed in the mitochondrial matrix from FAD and succinic acid in the presence of an enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. 9 ","Ubiquinone is a mobile electron carrier in the inner mitochondrial membrane. So UQ carries H2 from the inner side to the outer side of the membrane. Here it discharges 2 protons into the inner membrane space and donates its electrons to Cyt b. Cyt b hands over its electrons to FeS. FeS passes its electrons to UQ of another enzyme. Now UQ becomes UQH 2 and carries H 2 from inner side to the outer side of the membrane. Here it liberates 2 protons to the inner membrane space and donates its 2 electrons Cyt c1 .From Cyt c1 the electrons are transported to Cyt C, Cyt a and Cyt a3.Cyt c is also a mobile electron carrier seen in the inner mitochondrial membrane. From Cyt a3, the electron pass into the matrix. Hence 2 electrons recombine with 2 protons in the matrix to form two hydrogen atoms. These hydrogen atoms are accepted by molecular oxygen and they fuse to form a molecule of metabolic water. Thus oxygen acts as the final hydrogen acceptor. In citric acid cycle , it get oxidized into two molecules of CO2 while capturing the electrons in the form of 6 NADH molecules and two molecules of FADH 2 .These reduced molecules contain a pair of electrons with a high transfer potential. These electrons are transferred by a system of electron carriers to form H2O.This process occurs in the mitochondria and is the major source of energy to produce ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. The 6 NADH 2 and 2 FADH 2 formed in Krebs cycle provide about 22 ATP molecules of ATP in the electron transport chain. The electron transport chain is the third stage of cellular respiration. Five protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane form the electron transport chain. These complexes exist in a descending order of energy. Each complex contains several different electron carriers. Complex I also known as the NADH coenzyme Q reductase or NADH Dehydrogenase. 10 ","Complex II also known as succinate coenzyme Q reductase or Succinate dehydrogenase. Complex III also known as cytochrome c reductase. Complex IV also known as cytochrome c reductase. Complex V also known as ATP synthase. Complex I accepts electrons from NADH and serve as the link between glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation and the electron transport chain. Complex II contains succinate dehydrogenase and serves as a direct link between the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain. Complex I and II both produce reduced coenzyme Q, CoQH2 which is the substrate for complex III. Complex III transfers the electrons from cytochrome c to reduce molecular oxygen into water. Complex V is an enzyme which produce ATP by converting mechanical work into chemical energy, which powers most cellular reactions. A small amount of ATP is available from substrate level phosphorylation for example in glycolysis. Each of these complexes are large, multi subunit embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Here the electron carriers drop off all their electrons and protons that they picked up during the glycolysis and citric acid cycle stages. NADH+H+ and FADH2 become oxidized, donating electrons to the first and second protein complex, respectively. These complex proteins now become electron carriers themselves and are now reduced. They become oxidized as they pass these electrons down the electron transport chain. A single oxygen molecule accepts two electrons and two protons from the final protein complex. This produces a molecule of water. Oxidative phosphorylation: The ATP molecules are synthesised with the help of energy liberated by oxidation of reduced coenzymes NADH+H+ and FADH2) produced during respiration is called oxidative phosphorylation. The inner surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane bears many small outgrowths called oxysomes or Fo-F1 particles or elementary particles or inner membrane sub units. The base of oxysome has 3 parts- a base, a stalk, and a head piece. The base of oxysome is called F0. F0 is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The head piece is called F1.The enzyme required for ATP synthesis is ATP synthase. It is present in F1 head piece of oxysomes. F1 contains the site for ATP synthesis from ADP and inorganic phosphate. F0 forms the proton channel through which protons cross the inner mitochondrial membrane.ATP synthesis is explained by chemiosmotic theory (coupling hypothesis). It was proposed by Peter Mitschell . According to chemiosmotic theory, during ETS, the oxidation of one molecule of NADH+H + push 3 proton pairs into the intermembrane space and the oxidation of one molecule of FADH 2 push 2 proton pairs into the inter membrane space of the mitochondria. As a result proton concentration increases in the inter membrane space compared to the matrix. The difference in the proton concentration on the 2 sides of a system is called proton gradient. 11 ","As a result of proton gradient an electrochemical potential difference occurs across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This push protons back towards the mitochondrial matrix. But the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to protons except in the region of elementary particle (F0-F1 particle). F0-F1 particle functions as proton channel. The flow of electron back to mitochondrial matrix is driven by electrochemical proton gradient. During this back flow of protons the energy released is used for the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate in F1. One molecule of ATP is formed in the F1 as a result of two protons transported back through F0 from the intermembrane space to mitochondrial matrix. Oxidation of one NADH+H + through ETS forms 3 ATP molecules and oxidation of one FADH 2 forms 2 ATP molecule. 14.5 Respiratory balance sheet : The net gain of ATP from glucose molecule can be calculated on the following assumptions: • All steps of Glycolysis, Citric acid cycle and Electron transport system occur in sequential and orderly manner. • In glycolysis, the NADH undergo oxidative phosphorylation inside the mitochondria. • The intermediates produced in the pathway are not utilized to make any other compound. Only glucose molecules are broken down during respiration. These assumptions are not valid: • All the pathways are working simultaneously .It does not take place one after the other. • Substrates entering the pathway are withdrawn as and when necessary. • ATP is utilized whenever needed. • By multiple means the enzymatic rates are controlled. There is a net gain of 36 ATP molecules during aerobic respiration of one molecule of glucose. Comparison of aerobic respiration and fermentation: In aerobic respiration glucose is completely broken down to CO2 and water but in fermentation only partial breaking down of glucose takes place. More ATP molecules are produced in aerobic respiration, but only 2 ATP molecules are produced in fermentation when each molecule of glucose gets degraded to pyruvic acid. In aerobic respiration NADH is oxidized to NAD + very fast but in fermentation it is a slow process. 12 ","14.6 Amphibolic pathway : Breaking down process within living organism is called catabolism and synthesis is called anabolism. Both anabolism and catabolism are involved in respiratory pathway it is called amphibolic pathway. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are the respiratory substrates. They do not enter the respiratory pathway at the first step. The points of entry of different substrates may be varied. Before entering into the respiratory pathway these substrates become converted into the simple forms. Carbohydrates are converted into glucose before respiration. Fats would be broken down into glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol would enter the respiratory pathway after being converted to PGAL. Fatty acids would enter the pathway after being degraded to acetyl CoA. The proteins would be degraded into amino acids after deamination by protease enzyme. These would enter the pathway at so me stage within the Kreb’s cycle or as pyruvic acid or as acetyl CoA depending on their structure. Since the respiratory substrates are broken down during respiratory processes, traditionally it is considered as a catabolic process (catabolism) and the respiratory pathway is considered as a catabolic pathway. At certain points in the respiratory pathway, different substrates would enter to be respired and used to derive energy. Those compounds would be withdrawn from any point of the respiratory pathway in order to synthesize the above substrates. E.g: Fatty acids would be broken down to acetyl CoA before entering the respiratory pathway when it is used as substrate. Acetyl CoA would be withdrawn from the respiratory pathway when the organism need to synthesize fatty acids. So respiratory pathway includes both break down and synthesis of fatty acid. 14.7 Respiratory quotient: During aerobic respiration Oxygen is consumed and Carbon dioxide is released. Respiratory quotient is the ratio of the volume of CO2 evolved to the volume of O2 consumed in respiration. The R.Q value depends on the type of the substrate molecule. Respiratory quotient is determined with the help of an apparatus called respirometer. RQ= volume of CO2 evolved /volume of O2 consumed For carbohydrates the respiratory quotient is 1, for fats and proteins it is less than 1. 13 ","FAST TRACK REVISION: It is a characteristic process of every living cell. Respiration is the process in which glucose is broken down to release energy. It is an intracellular oxidation of organic compounds with release of carbon dioxide and energy. In respiration, substrate is enzymatically broken down in a step wise manner. Phase 1 is glycolysis (EMP pathway). It is completed in cytoplasm. These reaction involves further breakdown of pyruvic acid to form end products of respiration. Pyruvic acid metabolism can be aerobic or anaerobic. Phase II of aerobic respiration is completed in mitochondria. The oxidation of substrate is complete and the end products re CO2, H2O and 38 ATP molecules for every molecule of glucose. Phase II of anaerobic respiration is completed in cytoplasm only. The end products are ethyl alcohol, CO2 and energy. Fermentation is an anaerobic respiration. It is commonly found in saprophytic microorganisms like bacteria and fungi. End products are sometimes very useful. Alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation are the two most common type. 14 ","PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT All cells of the plant develop from the zygote. The development of a mature plant from the zygote follow a precise and highly ordered succession of events. It is actually the sum total of growth and differentiation. A complex body organization is formed during this process. The body produces roots, leaves, branches, flowers and seeds and after that the plant dies. 15.1 Growth : An irreversible permanent increase in size of an organ or its parts or even of an individual. One of the most fundamental characteristics of living things is their ability to grow and develop. A mature plant consists of numerous cell types because all the cells do not grow and develop in the same way. Growth is characteristic of living things. During growth several metabolic processes occurs like catabolism and anabolism . 15.1.1 Plant growth is generally indeterminate: In plants growth occurs by cell division and cell enlargement. Plants retain their capacity for unlimited growth throughout their life. This ability is due to the presence of meristems at certain locations in their body. Meristems are the actively dividing cells. The new cells produced by the meristems soon lose their capacity to divide and enter into the G 0 phase of the cell cycle and make up the plant body. This type of growth wherein new cells are always being added to the plant body by the activity of meristems is called open form of growth . As a result of open growth, plants are always growing and forming new organs to replace the older and senescent ones. Growth in plants may be of two types-Primary growth and secondary growth . Primary growth -The increase in length of axis by growth is called the primary growth. It takes place by the activity of the apical meristem and intercalary meristem. As a result of primary growth, length is increased. Secondary Growth: The increase in growth or thickness of the axis by growth is called secondary growth or secondary thickening. It takes place by the activity of lateral meristem. Vascular cambium and cork cambium are 1 ","the lateral meristem. Secondary growth brings about an increase in width of stem and root. As a result of growth, the dry weight is increased. In plants growth is not limited, where as in animals, growth is limited. 15.1.2 Growth is measurable: Growth is an increase in the quantity of protoplasm. Increase in the amount of protoplasm is difficult to measure directly, one generally measures some quantity which is more or less proportional to it. To measure growth different parameters can be used, like increase in fresh weight, dry weight, length, area, volume, cell number etc. One single maize root apical meristem can give rise to more than 17,500 new cells per hour, where as cells in a water melon fruit may increase in size by up to 3,50,000 times. 15.1.3 Phases of growth: The period of plant growth is divided into three stages. • Meristematic phase • Phase of elongation • Phase of maturation. Meristematic phase : During this phase, the cells in the growing region undergo mitotic division to form numerous cells. These cells are iso-diametric with prominent, large and conspicuous nucleus and rich protoplasm without vacuoles. They have thin cellulosic cell wall with many plasmodesmata. In higher plants, the meristematic phase takes place in meristems at root apex and shoot apex. Phase of elongation: It is the dominant phase in growth of plants. During this phase, the newly formed cells absorb more water. As a result, the turgidity and the amount of protoplasm increase. Vacuoles appear at the centre. The cell walls become more thickened. Due to these events, the cells enlarge. Enlargement of cells takes place in all directions. Rapid growth occurs during the phase of elongation. Phase of maturation: During this phase, the enlarged cells become differentiated to perform specific functions. 2 ","The matured cells gradually get differentiated into permanent tissues by attaining their maximum size in terms of wall thickening and protoplasmic modifications. The time interval from the meristematic phase to maturation phase is called Grand period of growth. 15.1.4 Growth rates: The expression of increased growth per unit time is called growth rate. The expression of growth rate mathematically is called arithmetic growth and geometrically is called geometrical growth. 3 ","In arithmetic growth, only one daughter cell continues to divide by mitotic division while the other daughter cell differentiates and mature. The arithmetic growth is simply expressed by a root elongation at a constant rate. On plotting the length of the organ against time, a linear curve is obtained. Mathematically it is expressed as: L t =L 0 + r t L t -length at time t L0=length at time zero r=growth rate/ elongation per unit time 4 ","Growth may not be sustained at a high rate throughout the life of cell or tissue or organ or organism. When the parameter of growth (weight, volume, size etc.) of a plant organ is measured and is plotted against time, and S shaped curve is obtained. This is called growth curve or sigmoid curve or S curve . In Geometric growth every cell divides with all daughter cells growing and dividing again. In geometric growth, the sigmoid curve consists of 3 parts-Lag phase, Exponential or log phase and stationary phase. Lag phase -During this phase, the rate of plant growth is generally slow. It is due to the utilization of reserve food materials. Exponential phase or Log phase - During this phase, the rate of growth increases rapidly. The rate of growth is exponential and reaches the maximum value. Here both the daughter cells following mitotic cell division retain the ability to divide and continue to do so. The limited nutrient supply slows down the growth and leads to a stationary phase. Stationary phase : During this phase, the ratio of growth again slows down due to the limitation of nutrients. A sigmoid curve is exhibited by numerous annual plants and individual parts of both annual and perennial plants. The exponential growth can be expressed a as W 1 = W 0 e rt W 1 =final size 5 ","W 0 = initial size r = growth rate t = time of growth e = base of natural logarithm Efficiency index is the ability of a plant to produce a new plant material. So the final size of W1 depends on the initial size W 0 Quantitative comparison between the growths of living systems can be made in 2 ways- absolute growth rate and relative growth rate. Absolute growth rate-It is the measurement and comparison of total growth per unit time. Relative growth rate- It is the growth of the given systems per unit time expressed on a common basis. E.g.: per unit initial parameter. Two leaves A and B .They are of different size of area .They show exact absolute increase in the area in a given time. One of them has much higher relative growth rate. Leaves A and B have grown by 5 cm 2 in one day. The initial size of leaf A was 5cm 2 and that of B was 50 cm 2 . Even though their absolute growth is the same, relative growth rate is faster in leaf A. 6 ","15.1.5 Conditions for growth: 1. Supply of nutrient, oxygen, water, sustainable temperature and light are necessary for proper growth. 2. Environmental signals like force of gravity and light etc. determine the directions of root growth and shoot growth and affect certain stages of growth. 3. Nutrients provide necessary material for the synthesis of protoplasm and act as a source of energy. 4. Water maintains turgidity of growing cell which helps in extension of growth. 5. Water provides medium for enzymatic reactions needed for growth. 6. Oxygen helps in releasing metabolic energy necessary for growth activities. 7. Temperature has thermotonic effect on growth. Optimum temperature for proper growth is 28 degree centigrade to 30 degree centigrade. Temperature above 45 degree centigrade results in the protoplasm of meristematic cells becoming coagulated and damaged. So, it inhibits proper growth. 8. During the initial stages of growth, light is not necessary. But light is required for further growth and photosynthesis. Light has a stimulating effect on plant growth. In the absence of light, growth is decreased in certain plants. This is called etiolation . 9. The presence of high concentration of salts, the deficiency of mineral nutrients, and stress factors negatively affect the rate of plant growth. 15.2 Differentiation, Dedifferentiation and Redifferentiation: The cells that arise from various meristems like root apical meristem, shoot apical meristem, and cambium eventually differentiate and mature to perform special functions. The process of specialization of cells that leads to their maturation is called differentiation. During differentiation, cells undergo different structural changes in their cells and protoplasm. 7 ","E.g. For the formation of tracheary element in phloem, the cells will be losing their protoplasm. They develop a very strong, elastic, lignocellulosic secondary wall. Some of the living and differentiated cells in plants can regain the capacity of cell division under certain conditions and is called dedifferentiation. Eg- formation of certain meristems. All interfascicular cambium, cork cambium, and wound meristems are derived from parenchyma cells. Callus formed from a parenchyma tissue in a culture medium is an example for dedifferentiated cells. The dedifferentiated cells or tissues can divide and produce new cells once again. They again lose their capacity to divide and mature to perform specific functions. This phenomenon is called redifferentiation. E.g.: Secondary xylem and secondary phloem from interfascicular cambium, secondary cortex and cork from cork cambium. Growth in plants is of open form. The cells arising from the same meristem have different structures at maturity. The final structure of a cell or tissue arising from the same meristem is determined by the location of the cells. E.g.: The cells positioned away from the root apical meristem differentiate as root cap cells, while those pushed to the periphery mature as epidermis. 15.3 Development: All changes from germination of the seed to senescence (ageing) constitute the development of a plant. The important aspects of growth are cell division and differentiation. Growth is a quantitative phenomenon whereas development is a qualitative phenomenon. The sum of growth and differentiation is called development. Plasticity is seen in plants in response to environment or phases of life to form different kinds of plant structures. E.g.: Heterophilly (occurrence of more than two types of leaves on the same plant) in larkspur, cotton, coriander etc. 8 ","In these heterophyllous plants, the leaves of the juvenile plant are different in shape than those in adult plants (developmental heterophilly). In some aquatic plants like butter cup ( Rannunculus flabellari and Rannunculus aquatilis ) and Limnophylla heterophylla the shapes of leaves produced in the air are different. In these plants, the aerial and floating leaves are generally broad while submerged leaves are ribbon shaped, linear and dissected (environmental heterophilly). In plants, development is under the control of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The intrinsic factors or internal factors include intracellular or genetic factors and intracellular factors -chemicals like plant growth regulators. Extrinsic factors include light, temperature, water, Oxygen, nutrition etc. 15.4: Plant growth regulators: 15.4.1 Characteristics: In plants, certain chemical substances occurring in minute quantities regulate growth and differentiation. These chemical substances are called plant growth regulators or phytohormones or plant hormones or plant growth substances . They are influenced by the genetic makeup and environment. They play an important role in the growth and differentiation of plants. Plant hormones are organic compounds which are capable of influencing physiological activities leading to promotion, inhibition and modification of growth. The growth regulators have a positive effect or a negative effect in the growth of a plant. If it has a positive effect on a process it can promote it and has a negative effect it causes inhibition of the process. Based on the functions, the PGRs can be divided into 2 groups-growth promoting hormones and growth inhibiting hormones. Growth promoting hormones - The Plant Growth Regulators are involved in various growth promoting activities - cell division, cell enlargement pattern formation, tropic growth, flowering, fruiting, seed formation etc. - Auxins, Gibberellins and Cytokinins. Growth inhibiting hormones-These Plant Growth Regulators are involved in various growth inhibiting activities like dormancy and abscission (shedding of leaves, flowers and fruits) .They also play important role in plant responses to wounds and stresses of biotic and abiotic origin. ABA (abscisic acid) belongs to this group . 9 ","Gaseous PGR – Ethylene, could fit either of the groups, but it largely inhibits growth activities. 15.4.2 The Discovery of Plant Growth Regulators: The first indication of the existence of PGR came from the work of Charles Darwin and his son Francis Darwin while working on canary grass ( Phalaris canariensis ) demonstrated the bending of grass coleoptiles towards unilateral source of light (phototropism). After conducting many experiments, it was found that the site of transmittable influence was the tip of the coleoptiles which caused the bending of the entire coleoptiles. Later the experiments conducted in different laboratories, resulted in the discovery of the first PGR called Auxin. In 1928 F.W Went isolated auxin from coleoptiles ’ tips of Oats ( Avena sativa ) He cut off the tip of the Avena sativa coleoptiles and so the remaining portion of the coleoptiles do not possess auxin to elongate. Then he placed the excised tip of coleoptiles on a cube of agar. Auxin diffused into the cube. The coleoptiles tip was removed and the agar block containing auxin was placed on one side of another decapitated coleoptiles tip. Auxin moved down the coleoptiles directly below it, and caused greater elongation of cells along that side of the coleoptiles than on the opposite side. Thus curvature was caused. It was by differential growth rates on the two sides. From this experiment, F.W Went proved that the substance always moved from the apex towards the base of the coleoptiles. Agar blocks containing auxin (diffused substance) when placed on decapitated coleoptiles could induce the action of the apex. F.W.Went named this substance as auxin and concluded that no growth can occur without auxin. Kogl and Haagen Smith in 1931 isolated first naturally occurring auxin from human urine. E.Kurosawa discovered gibberellins. Skoog and Miller identified and crystallized kinetin (cytokinin). 10 ","During mid 1960’s 3 independent researches purified and studied the chemical characterization of 3 different kinds of plant growth inhibitors-inhibitor B, Abscission II, and dormin. Later all the three were proved to be chemically identical and named it as ABA (Abscisic acid). Cousins identified the gaseous hormone Ethylene by reporting the release of volatile substance from ripened oranges that increased the rate of ripening of stored unripened bananas. 15.4.3 Physiological Effects of Plant Growth Regulators: 15.4.3.1 Auxins: Indole derivative. Auxins are of two types-Natural auxin and Synthetic auxin. Natural auxins - It occur naturally and includes IAA (Indole Acetic Acid), IBA (Indole Butyric Acid), IPA (Indole 3 Pyruvic Acid). IAA, IBA, IPA have been isolated from plants. Of these IAA is found in all plants and fungi. Synthetic auxins -The synthetic compounds which function as auxins are called synthetic auxins. Some of them are NAA (Naphthalene acetic Acid), 2-4 D (2,4, Dichlorophenoxy Acetic Acid), 2,4,5 T(2,4,5,-Trichlorophenoxy Acetic Acid) and PAA (Phenyl Acetic Acid). Auxins plays an important role in agriculture and horticulture. The important applications of auxins are: Plant propagation • Promotes apical dominance- It is the phenomenon by which the presence of auxins in the shoot apex inhibits the growth of lateral buds and promote the growth of apical buds. Decapitation promotes the growth of lateral buds. This aspect is employed in tea plantation and in gardening for hedge making. 11 ","• Promotes abscission of mature leaves and prevents abscission of immature leaves. At the time of shedding, they stop producing auxin. NAA is used to control pre-harvest fruit drop. • Initiates rooting from stem cuttings. Hence used in vegetative propagation of plants. • Auxin normally inhibit flowering in all plants except in pine apple and litchi. • Induce parthenocarpy in tomato. • 2, 4, D is an inducer selective weedicide to remove broad leaved weeds. • Auxins controls differentiation of xylem and helps in cell division. Hence used in tissue culture along with cytokinins. Bioassay - (To determine the activity of a substance) for Auxins are Avena curvature test and Root growth inhibition test. 15.4.3.2 Gibberellins: Terpene derivative . These are known as Gibberellic acid (GA). GA were first isolated by Yabuta and Samuki in 1939 from an ascomycetous fungus, Gibberella fujikuroi which causes foolish seedling disease or bakanae disease in rice seedlings. This fungus is now known as Gibberella monoliforme . The affected plants have a tendency to appear taller, paler, thinner and without seeds. The highest level of Gibberellins is detected in seeds. There are more than 100 GAs and are named as GA1, GA2, GA3, etc. GA3 is the first discovered GA and the most intensively studied Gibberellic acid. Gibberellins are produced in fungi and also in plants. • Promotes cell elongation especially of intermodal cells and causes elongation of axis. Hence used to promote production of grapes with long stalks. • Promote the production of large apples with definite shape. • Promote bolting (Internodal elongation prior to flowering) in cabbage, carrot, Beet root etc. 12 ","• Increase sugar yield by increasing length of the stem of sugar cane. • It induces parthenocarpy in Pome fruits such as apple and pear. • It controls flowering in long day plants. Gibberellins can be applied as a substitute for long day requirements in long day plants. • Sex expression – It controls sex expression in certain species. Generally it promotes the production of male flowers. • Gibberellin stimulates the production of male flowers in genetically female plants of Cannabis . • Seed Germination- it induces germination of positively photoblastic seeds of lettuce and tobacco in complete darkness. • Genetic dwarfism- it is caused by the mutation of a single gene which may cause a block in the metabolic pathway leading to gibberellins synthesis. Gibberellin treatment on genetically dwarf varieties of pea, maize etc. cause them to grow tall by the elongation of internodes. Dwarfism is due to the deficiency of gibberellins. It has no effect on roots. • Increase rate of malting (conversion of starch into maltose sugar in brewing by increasing production of enzyme alpha amylase). • Break seed dormancy and promote seed germination. • It delays senescence and so used to extent the market period of fruits by keeping the fruits on the trees. • Spraying of gibberellins on juvenile conifers hastens its maturity period and promote early seed production. Bioassay for Gibberellins are Dwarf pea test, Dwarf Corn test and Barley endosperm bioassay. 15.4.3.3 Cytokinins: Cytokinesis promoting plant hormone are called cytokinins or kinins. The term Cytokinin was proposed by Letham in 1964.There are about 18 different types of cytokinins identified. Chemically cytokinins are the derivatives of adenine. The first discovered cytokinin is kinetin. It was a modified form of adenine, a purine (6 furfuryl amino purine). It was first isolated by Miller and Skoog from the autoclaved herring sperm DNA (fish DNA) in 1955. Kinetin does not occur naturally in plants. In 1964 Lethom isolated the first naturally occurring cytokinins called zeatin from corn kernels and coconut milk. Functions and applications: • Promote cell division. It cannot act alone. Cytokinin is considered as the true cell division factor. It plays a vital role in the morphogenesis (Organ formation) of plants. It is used in tissue culture experiments. In tissue culture, cytokinin in association with auxin promotes cell division in the parenchyma cells. None of these two hormones in itself can promote mitosis. • Cell enlargement and cell differentiation- The kinetin-auxin interaction controls cell differentiation of shoot and root meristems. If both are present in equal quantities, cells divide but do not differentiate. The proportion of these two hormones controls organ formation in callus. If more cytokinin is present than auxin, shoot buds develop from a callus, and if more auxin is present than cytokinin, roots develop. • Overcome apical dominance- Auxin promotes the growth of apical bud, whereas cytokinin promotes the growth of lateral buds. Thus two hormones can act antagonistically in the control of apical dominance. 13 ","• Delays senescence. Thus retards ageing of plant organs or plants by mobilization of resources and controlling protein synthesis. • The leaves dipped in cytokinins stay green longer than control leaves. The effect of cytokinin in retarding ageing is called Richmond Lang Effect. • Breaking dormancy- They induce the breaking of seed dormancy, and also promote seed germination. • Delay leaf senescence- Cytokinins promote nutrient mobilization which helps in the delay of leaf senescence. Bioassay -Chlorophyll preservation test, Excised cell enlargement test, and Germination and differentiation test . 15.4.3.4 Ethylene -It is a simple gaseous growth inhibiting PGR. It is synthesized in large amounts by tissues undergoing senescence, and by ripening fruits. High concentration of auxins stimulate ethylene production. It is produced in plants from the amino acid methionine. Maximum ethylene formation takes place during the ripening of fruits. Ethylene stimulates the activity of the cellulase enzyme, and there by the cellulose is broken down. As a result the tissues become softened. Ethylene is a natural product of metabolism in plants. Functions and uses-• Ethylene promotes horizontal growth of seedling, swelling of axis and apical hook formation in dicot seedling (Triple response). Triple response test is the bioassay of ethylene. • Ethylene promotes elongation of internode and leaf petiole in deep water paddy plants so as to keep the shoot tips above water level. • Induce flowering in pineapple and litchi. • Promote sprouting of bulbs in Potato, Ginger and Amorphophallus . • Promotes development of roots and root hair hence increases surface area for absorption. • Initiate germination of pea nut seeds. Ethylene is the most widely sued PGR in agriculture – in the form of Ethephone and Ethrel . Ethephone is used as aqueous foliar spray. It is easily absorbed by the leaves and slowly released as ethylene within the plant. Applications: • Used to promote ripening of tomato and apple fruits. • To increase cucumber yield by increasing production of female flowers. • To accelerate abscission of flowers and fruits (thinning). In cotton, Cherry, Walnut etc. • Ethelyne is used in rubber tapping to increase the flow of latex. 15.4.3.5 Abscisic acid: Abscisic acid is a naturally occurring plant growth inhibitor and an inhibitor of plant metabolism. It is weakly acidic in nature. It was first isolated by Addicot in 1963 from cotton fruits. ABA is called dormin because it causes bud dormancy. It is isolated from different parts of higher plants. It is synthesized in leaves and then translocated to stem tips through phloem. It interacts with other growth regulators. Functions and use - 14 ","• It inhibits seed germination • Inhibits growth of excised embryos • Stimulation of closing of stomata during severe drought and hence called as stress hormone. • It inhibits mitosis in vascular cambium • It acts as an antagonist to gibberellins. • It regulates dormancy of buds, tubers, and seeds by inhibiting the growth processes. As ABA inhibits gibberellins stimulated growth in plants, it is called antigibberellins.ABA act as an antagonist to GA3. Dormant seeds germinate when ABA is overcome by gibberellins. 15.5 Photoperiodism -The response of the plant to the relative length of day and night for flowering is called photoperiodism. The term photoperiodism was first used by Garner and Allard. They first demonstrated photoperiodism in Nicotiana tobacum (Maryland Mammoth variety of tobacco). A day length or daily duration of light is referred to as a photoperiod or critical duration. Continuous 12 hours of day length is called critical day duration and the continuous 12 hours darkness is called critical dark duration. According to the photoperiodic responses Garner and Allard classified the flowering plants into 3 groups. • Short day plants • Long day plants • Day neutrals 1. Short day plants -Produce flowers when exposed to duration of light lesser than the critical duration. They need long night than the critical dark period for flowering. Also called as long night plants. E.g.: Cosmos, Dahlia, Rice, Sugar cane, potato etc. 2. Long Day plants -These plant produce flowers when exposed to duration of light greater than critical day duration. These plants require a short night than the critical dark period. So they are also known as short night plants. E.g.: Wheat, Barley, Sugar beet, Cabbage, Spinach, Radish etc. 3. Day Neutrals - Produce flowers irrespective of the light period. After completing the vegetative phase starts the flowering. They are also called as Inter mediated day plants or Photoneutral plants. E.g.: Sunflower, Tomato, Corn, Pea, Cotton etc. 15 ","Long short day plants – These are short day plants but must be exposed to long days during early period of growth for subsequent flowering. E.g.: Bryophyllum . Short long day plants-These are long day plants, they require short days for floral initiation and long day for blossoming. E.g.: Certain varieties of wheat and rye. In 1936 Chailakhyan suggested that a flowering hormone is synthesized in the leaves soon after perceiving the required favourable photoperiod and this flowering hormone is named as florigen. 15.6 Vernalisation -The low temperature treatment (0 to 5 degree centigrade) for flowering is called vernalisation. Also called as Chilling treatment or Yarovization . The term was first used by Lysenko. The low temperature treatment was first realized by Klippart while working on wheat varieties. Vernalisation stimulus is perceived by the embryo of seed, especially plumule tips. Natural vernalisation is observed in plants like Wheat, Barley and Rye and also in biennial monocarpic plants like cabbage, Carrot, Sugar beet etc. Vernalisation is due to a hormone called vernalin by G.Melchers. Vernalin is now identified as Gibberellin. Vernalin may be considered as the precursor of florigen. If vernalised seedlings or seeds are subjected to higher temperature like 35 to 40 degree centigrade the plants that develop from such treatment fail to flower. Such a nullifying effect by higher temperature is called devernalisation. FAST TRACK REVISION: Growth is an irreversible increase in mass, volume, or weight of an organism accompanied by increase in dry weight. 16 ","Plants show limited and unlimited growth, parts of the plant like fruits and leaves show limited growth where as stem and root show unlimited growth. The rate of growth can be measured by plotting growth against time. Growth curve or sigmoid growth curve is S shaped curve showing three phases namely lag phase, log and stationary phase. Cells in their life cycle shows three phases-cell division phase, cell enlargement phase and cell maturation phase. Development is the sum total of growth and differentiation. Growth is controlled by internal factors like hormones, which can both promote and inhibit growth. Plant hormones are Auxins, Gibberellins, Cytokinins, Ethylene and Abscisic acid. The response of the plants to the relative length of day and night is called photoperiodism. Promotion of flowering in biennial plants by cold treatment is called vernalisation. 17 ","DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION The branch of biology which deals with the study of life processes is called Human Physiology. Major human physiological processes are digestion and absorption, Exchange of gases, blood circulation, excretion, locomotion and movement, neural coordination, chemical coordination etc. Father of modern physiology is William Harvey. Food is the substance used for growth, maintenance and activities of an organism and it is a mixture of nutritive and nonnutritive substances. The nutrients are the chemical substances present in food. The physiological activity by which organisms obtain food from their environment is called nutrition. Major components of food are carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals and vitamins. Water prevents dehydration of the body and plays an important role in metabolic processes. The process of converting food materials into simple, soluble, and absorbable form is called digestion. The two processes coming under digestion are mechanical processes and bio chemical processes. Mechanical process includes the breaking down of complex food materials into simpler forms by physical means, such as cutting, tearing, crushing, chewing, pressing, rolling etc. Biochemical process involves the breaking down of covalent bonds in the organic food molecules into simpler molecules by hydrolysis. 16.1 Digestive system: Human digestive system consist of a well developed alimentary canal, and associated glands. 16.1.1 Alimentary canal: It is a long coiled tube which is muscular and about 6m to 9 m in length extending from mouth to anus. It is lined by glandular epithelium and consist of a mouth, oral cavity or buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus. The major associated glands associated with the alimentary canal are salivary glands, gastric glands, liver, pancreas, gall bladder, and intestinal glands. All these organs are connected to the alimentary canal by a series of ducts. 1 ","Mouth and Oral cavity: Mouth is a transverse slit like opening which is surrounded by two soft movable lips. Mouth leads into the oral cavity and its roof is called palate . Oral cavity is bordered internally by a pair of jaws called upper maxilla (upper jaw) and lower mandible (lower jaw) .The cheeks form the lateral walls of the oral cavity. At the hind end of the palate is a small finger shaped extension called uvula and the buccal cavity is lined by stratified squamous epithelium secreting mucous which lubricates the cavity. A muscular tongue is situated on the floor of the oral cavity which is attached by a thin fold of frenulum. It helps in ingestion, chewing and swallowing of food materials and also bears taste buds for recognizing four types of tastes called sour, salt, bitter and sweet, in the indigested food materials. When moist food is in contact with these taste buds, we get the sensation of taste. Teeth: The masticatory apparatus developed from specialized cells in the skin covering the jaw. The number, arrangement and shape of teeth is called dentition. The dentition in human is described as thecodont, heterodont and diphyodont . If teeth are found in cavities called teeth sockets off the upper and lower jaw bones, it is called thecodont dentition. In an adult human being there are 32 teeth, a row of 16 in each jaw. There are four types of teeth based on their function. They are Incisors, Canines, Premolars and Molars . Having different types of teeth is called heterodont dentition. Incisors-Chisel shaped with sharp cutting edges used for cutting the food into pieces. 2 ","Canines-Dagger shaped and used for tearing the food. Premolars and molars-Strong and have broad flat surfaces for crushing and grinding the food. In man, the last four molars -2 in upper and 2 in lower jaw come out only after a person has reached the age of 17 or 18.These four molar teeth are called wisdom teeth. Two sets of teeth appear in life time of man-Milk teeth and permanent teeth and are called diphyodont dentition. Milk teeth are weak and temporary teeth developed in child hood. All premolars and molars are absent. Dentition consist of 20 teeth, 10 in each jaw. The number and arrangement of teeth on either side of each jaw is called dental formula. In adult man there are 16 teeth on each jaw. I - 2/2 C - 1/1 P - 2/2 M - 3/3 = 16 x 2 = 32 The dental formula for milk dentition is I - 2/2 C - 1/1 P - 0/0 M - 2/2= 10 x 2 = 20 The crown part of the tooth is covered by a non living white substance containing calcium salts called enamel. It is the hardest material in human body which forms the chewing surface of the tooth and is rich in calcium, phosphate and calcium carbonate. Due to the presence of teeth in the buccal cavity, mastication takes place in the buccal cavity. Pharynx: It is a funnel shaped muscular passage common for both respiratory and digestive system. The buccal cavity leads to pharynx and the nasal cavity opens into it from above. It opens into oesophagus and trachea posteriorly. The opening of the pharynx into the trachea is the glottis and it is always kept open for respiration. A cartilaginous flap of skin called epiglottis cover the glottis and prevent the entry of food into the trachea while swallowing and uvula closes the opening into the nasal cavity. 3 ","Oesophagus: Long muscular tube about 30 cm in length and connects the pharynx with the stomach. It passes through the neck, thorax and pierce the diaphragm (muscular partition wall which separates the thorax from the abdomen). The wave like contraction and relaxation of the muscular wall of oesophagus is called peristalsis. By the peristaltic movement of the walls of the oesophagus, food reaches the stomach. The gastro-oesophageal sphincter muscles controls the opening of oesophagus in the stomach. Stomach: The widest part of the alimentary canal. It is located in the upper left region of the abdominal cavity. It is a large muscular bag just below the diaphragm which is C shaped. The three regions of the stomach are fundus, cardiac and pylorus. The fundus is superior to the cardiac region. It is a temporary storage area which is filled with air that enters the stomach while swallowing. The oesophagus opens into the fundus. Cardiac is the middle region where food is mainly stored. Pylorus or antrum is the posterior narrow region which leads into the small intestine by an opening called pyloric orifice which is guarded by a ring shaped muscle called pyloric sphincter. When it relaxes, food material passes into the small intestine. Numerous gastric glands are present on the wall of the stomach which secrete gastric juice. When stomach is empty, its mucous membrane is thrown into numerous folding called rugae which project into the lumen of the stomach. 4 ","Small Intestine: Coiled, narrow, tubular and forms the longest part of the alimentary canal. It is about 7 to 9 m in length and 2.4 cm in diameter. It lies in the abdomen. It is differentiated into duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Duodenum: First part and is curved in the form of U. The liver and pancreas opens into the duodenum by a common duct. Jejunum: Duodenum is followed by jejunum and is longer than duodenum. Ileum: Last and longest part of small intestine. About 7m is length and 2 to 3 cm in diameter. Highly coiled and opens into large intestine in the lower right region of the abdominal cavity. The jejunum and ileum are often called the mesenteric part of small intestine. Major part of digestion and absorption takes place in small intestine. Large intestine: Small intestine opens into large intestine. It is much shorter and wider than small intestine and 2 m in long. Differentiated into three regions- Caecum, colon and rectum . Caecum is very small pouch like in human and very large and spacious in horse and ass. A blind finger shaped process arising from the caecum is the vermiform appendix which is functionless organ in human and is called vestigial organ. Colon is the largest part of large intestine. Colon differentiated into ascending colon (running upwards), transverse colon (running across the abdomen) and descending colon (running downwards). The descending colon is continued into the rectum .Rectum store the faeces temporarily and opens out through the anus. The anus is guarded by a voluntary sphincter muscle. 5 ","Histology of human alimentary canal: The wall of human alimentary canal from oesophagus to rectum is made up of 4 major layers- • Serosa • Muscularis • Submucosa • Mucosa. Serosa is the outermost layer of the alimentary canal and is a fibrous coat made up of thin mesothelium with some connective tissue. Muscularis is seen outside the submucosa. Formed of an inner layer of circular muscles and an outer layer of longitudinal muscles. An oblique muscle layer may be seen in some regions. Submucosa: Seen just outside the mucosa. It is formed of loose connective tissue layer with blood vessel and lymph vessels. It is supplied with nerves. Duodenal glands are also seen in submucosa. Mucosa : Innermost lining layer of the lumen of the alimentary canal. It has moist and friction resistant lining of epithelium. Secretory cells and absorptive cells are found in the epithelium. The goblet cells of the epithelium secrete mucous which function as lubricant and protects the epithelial surface from damage and digestion. When the stomach is empty, the mucosa and submucosa are thrown into large folds called rugae . It helps the stomach to stretch and folds disappear when the stomach is filled with food materials. The mucosa of the human small intestine has millions of microscopic finger like protections called villi. 6 ","Structure of the villi: Villi are the microscopic folds or the finger like projections found in the mucosa of the human small intestine. Each villus consist of network of blood capillaries, a net work of lymph vessels and an outer layer of columnar epithelial cells. At the centre of each villus there is a large central lymph vessel called lacteal. Each epithelial cells of the villus has many as 2000 to 3000 short protoplasmic bristle like projections called microvilli or brush border. Villi increase the surface area of the intestinal mucosa and consequently help in enhancing the absorption of nutrients. The total surface area of small intestine is about 200 sq.m. The digested food is absorbed by the walls of the epithelial cells of the villi. 16.1.2 Digestive glands: The lands associated with the alimentary canal and help in digestion of food materials is called digestive glands. They are salivary glands, liver and pancreas. Salivary glands : Digestive glands secrete saliva .Located in the oral cavity. In humans there are three pairs of salivary glands- • Parotid glands • Sublingual gland 7 ","• Submandibular or submaxillary glands. Parotid glands are large and located just below and in front of ears. Sublingual glands are found below the tongue on the floor of the mouth. Submandibular glands or submaxillary glands lie below the angles of the lower jaw bone. All these glands secrete saliva which reaches the oral cavity through their salivary ducts. Saliva is a clear watery fluid and man secretes about 1.5 litres of saliva per day. It is slightly alkaline and contains 99.5% of water and 0.5% residual substances which include digestive enzymes, mucin, electrolytes and inorganic salts. Saliva in man contains starch digesting enzymes called salivary amylase and an antimicrobial agent known as lysozyme. Salivary amylase digests starch and glycogen into maltose. It is absent in cow, buffalo, goat, tiger, lion etc. Saliva contains the electrolytes like Na + , K -, Cl -, HCO 3 – which are derived from the blood plasma, mucous and serous fluid. Functions of saliva are: • Prevent the deteriorative processes in the oral cavity. • Helps in washing away pathogenic bacteria. • Thiocyanate ions and Proteolytic enzymes in the saliva can destroy bacteria. • Protein antibodies in saliva are capable of destroying oral bacteria which cause dental caries. Liver: Largest gland in the human body. Weigh about 1.2 to 1.5Kg in adult man and has a dark chocolate colour. It is located in the right upper part of the abdomen just below the diaphragm. It is a bilobed gland with a small left lobe and a large right lobe. Lobules are the structural and functional unit of liver. Lobule is enclosed within a capsule called Glison’s capsule. Each lobule composed of Hepatic cells, Kupffers cells and blood filled spaces called sinusoids. Hepatic cells secrete bile and Kuppffer’s cell digest bacteria, foreign particles, damaged blood cells etc. Secretion of liver is bile which is alkaline, watery greenish fluid and it contains bile pigments, cholesterol, mucin, phospholipids, bile salts, and water. Two types of bile pigments- Biliverdin and bilirubin. Biliverdin is a green pigment and bilirubin is a reddish yellow pigment. 8 ","Bile salts are sodium taurocholate and sodium glycocholate which helps in the digestion of fats and absorption of fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. No enzymes are present in bile. Bile passes into the hepatic ducts. Cystic duct arises from the gall bladder. Hepatic and cystic duct join to form a common bile duct and joins with the pancreatic duct to form a common hepatopancreatic duct before opening into the duodenum. Sphincter which guards the common duct is Sphincter of Oddi . Pancreas: It is an elongated digestive gland found in the bend of the duodenal loop and it is the second largest gland in the human body which is 12-15 cm long and has a reddish yellow colour. Pancreatic juice is the secretion of pancreas and it is a clear, watery, alkaline fluid rich in enzymes for digesting starch, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. It is released into pancreatic duct or Duct of Wirsung which joins with the common bile duct to form hepatopancreatic duct and it opens into the duodenal loop. Pancreas has two portions-Endocrine and exocrine part. Exocrine part is made up of glandular chambers called acini or alveoli which secrete alkaline pancreatic juice containing enzymes. Endocrine part made up of scattered patches of cells called Islets of Langerhans which secrete the hormones-insulin and glucagon. It is composed of three types of cells- • Alpha cells-secrete glucagon • Beta cells secrete insulin • Delta cells secrete somatostatin. 16.2 Digestion of food : Digestion involve mechanical and chemical digestion. Mechanical digestion : The breaking the food into smaller pieces physically through mastication, insalivation and by the peristaltic movement of the alimentary canal wall. 9 ","Chemical digestion: Saliva is secreted in mouth which gets mixed with food particles that digest it partly. The main components in saliva are mucin, lysozyme, thiocyanate and ptyalin which help in digestion. Mucin is a glycoprotein that lubricates the food particles which in turn swallows the food. Lysozyme is a bactericidal which kills the harmful bacteria. Ptyalin is present in the saliva digest the starch into maltose. Only 30% of starch is digested in the mouth. Ptyalin is present in the human saliva, as the food consumed is mainly made up of starch. Ptyalin can digest only ripe and cooked starch while cannot digest the raw starch. Teeth and tongue masticate, lubricate and adhere the food into bolus with the help of saliva and is conveyed into pharynx by swallowing or deglutination. Swallowing is a reflex action that, along with peristaltic wave, pushes the food down the different sections of the alimentary canal. Bolus moves to the oesophagus and by the peristaltic movement of oesophagus food enters into the stomach through the gastro oesophageal sphincter. Digestion in the stomach: The digestion of food in the stomach is called gastric digestion. The insalivated bolus entering and filling the stomach stretches its walls, straightening the rugae. These walls now crush, knead and roll and churn the food which mixes the food thoroughly with the gastric juice secreted by the gastric glands. There are four types of cells which produce their secretion and spread it all over the inner region of the stomach: Mucous neck cells or Goblet cells - They secrete the alkaline mucous for protecting the epithelium from hydrochloric acid. Mucous cells are found in the fundic, cardiac, and pyloric region of the stomach. Parietal cells or oxyntic cells - Seen in the fundic, cardiac, and pyloric region. They secrete hydrochloric acid. Acidic medium is essential for the activation to release pepsin for protein digestion from the gastric glands. It kills micro-organisms entered along with the food. Chief cells (Zymogenic cells or peptic cells) secrete pepsin and are located in the fundic region. G cells – Located in the fundic, pyloric, and gastric region which secrete gastrin for the secretion of hydrochloric acid. 10 ","The secretion of gastric glands is collectively called gastric juices and they are acidic in reaction because it contains dilute HCl. About 99% of gastric juice is water and the remaining is formed of pepsinogen, prorenin, gastric lipase, mucous, HCl, bicarbonates etc. Stomach stores food for 4 to 6 hours. The food after gastric digestion is acidic, semi digested and in a paste like form known as chyme . This passes little by little through the pyloric sphincter of the stomach into duodenum of small intestine. The mucosal epithelium is protected and lubricated due to the presence of mucus and bicarbonates in the gastric juice. They protect the mucosal epithelium from damage by the highly concentrated HCl. Digestion in the intestine : The chyme enters into the small intestine. Chyme in duodenum results in distension and it increases the osmotic pressure. The acidic chime get neutralized by the bile secreted from the liver. It is followed by the alkaline part of the pancreatic juice and the mucus secretion by Brunners gland. Food gets mixed with bile, mucus and pancreatic juice enters into the jejunum and ileum and mix with the intestinal juice called succus entericus. Complete digestion occurs here due to the chemical action of various digestive enzymes in the intestinal juice and through the peristaltic and pendulous movement of the intestine. Intestinal glands are of two types-Crypts of Lieberkuhn and Brunners gland. Crypts of Leiberkunh – These are the invaginations of the mucosa of the small intestine between the villi and they open at the base of the villi. They have three types of secreting cells- Goblet cells-secrete mucus Paneth cells-secrete large number of digestive enzymes Enterocytes- secrete water and electrolytes. Brunners gland-Tubular glands found in the submucosa of the duodenum. They secrete a viscous, enzyme free, alkaline and watery fluid called mucoid fluid which helps the duodenum to withstand the acidic chime entering from the stomach until it is neutralized by the alkaline pancreatic juice and bile. Secretion of both intestinal and Brunners gland are called succucs entericus which is a slightly straw coloured alkaline fluid containing a number of enzymes, mucous and inorganic salts. The fully digested food after intestinal 11 ","digestion appears as a semifluid known as chyle. From the chyle the absorption of digested products of food occurs. Action of pancreatic enzymes are Intestinal enzymatic action are B iomacromolecules are broken down in the duodenum and their absorption takes place in jejunum and ilium. Undigested food particles moves into the large intestine through ileo-caecal valve. Large intestine: In the large intestine water and minerals are absorbed and the walls secrete mucus for adhering and lubrication. The undigested food in the solid form called faeces are temporarily stored in the rectum and through the process of defecation it is thrown out of the body through the anus. 16.3 Absorption of digested food: The process by which the digested products and other nutrient molecules are taken into different cells or tissues from the alimentary canal is called absorption. The products of digestion are glucose, amino acids, fatty acids, glycerol, purines, pyramidines, mineral salts, vitamins, water etc. The principal site for the absorption of digested food is the small intestine. Major part of the digested food is absorbed in the ileum of the small intestine. In the small intestine, the digested products are absorbed mainly through the microvilli of the absorptive cells. Large intestine also helps in the absorption of water. Absorption of digested food takes place by passive absorption or active absorption or by facilitated transport mechanisms. Simple diffusion- glucose, amino acids and some of electrolytes like chloride ions are absorbed by simple diffusion. Facilitated diffusion for the absorption of fructose and some amino acids with the help of carrier ions like Na + . 12 ","Transport of water takes place based on the osmotic gradient. Active transport is against the concentration gradient. So they need energy in the form of ATP. Amino acids, monosacharides (glucose), electrolytes like Na + are absorbed by active transport. As fatty acids and glycerol are insoluble, they cannot be absorbed by blood. So they are first broken down into small droplets called micelles. Then it move into the intestinal mucosa. Then they are converted into small protein coated fat globules (Chylomicrons) and are carried to the lymph vessel in the villi. From there it reaches the blood stream. Absorption takes place in mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. Maximum absorption is in the small intestine. Assimilation is the process by which the absorbed food reaches the various tissues through blood and utilizing them .The undigested food in the solid for (faeces) is stored in the rectum which initiates aneural reflex causing an urge for the removal of faeces. The process of removal of faeces from the body is called defecation. 16.4 Disorders of the digestive system : The intestinal tract is often inflamed by bacterial and viral infections. The infections are also caused by the parasites of the intestine such as tape worm, round worm, thread worm, hook worm, pin worm etc. The common disorders of digestive system are jaundice, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, indigestion etc. 1. Jaundice: A high level of bile pigments in the blood cause the skin, eyes, and mucous membrane appear yellow and this condition is called jaundice. 2. Vomiting : It is the ejection of stomach contents through mouth due to blockage of gut or reverse peristalsis. This vomiting reflex action is controlled by the vomit centre in the medulla oblongata. A feeling of nausea precedes vomiting. 3. Diarrhoea: If the absorption of water is not taking place properly, the faeces becomes watery and frequently discharged. The abnormal frequency of bowel movement and increased liquidity of the faecal discharge is called diarrhoea. It reduces the absorption of food. 4. Constipation: By the excessive absorption of water from the large intestine, the faecal matter becomes extremely dry and hard. The muscle of the colon of the large intestine becomes extremely dry and hard. The muscles of the colon of the large intestine become incapable of their normal peristaltic movements and remain contracted. As a result, the faeces is retained within the rectum and defecation occurs at prolonged intervals. This condition is called constipation. Constipation and diarrhoea are the conditions of irregular defecation. Constipation can be avoided by eating food with sufficient cellulose fibres. 5. Indigestion: It is the condition leading to a feeling of fullness due to improper digestion. The causes of indigestion are inadequate enzyme, secretion, anxiety, food poisoning, over eating, spicy food etc. 13 ","FAST TRACK REVISION: Food is the substance used for growth, maintenance and activities of an organism and it is a mixture of nutritive and nonnutritive substances. The process of converting food materials into simple, soluble, and absorbable form is called digestion. Human digestive system consists of a well developed alimentary canal, and associated glands. Alimentary canal is lined by glandular epithelium and consists of a mouth, oral cavity or buccal cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and anus. The dentition in human is described as thecodont, heterodont and diphyodont. Pharynx is a funnel shaped muscular passage common for both respiratory and digestive system. By the peristaltic movement of the walls of the oesophagus, the food enters into the stomach. Stomach wall contains gastric glands which produce gastric juice. Into the duodenum opens the duct from pancreas and liver. Complete digestion of the food takes place by the intestinal juice succus entericus. The walls of the large intestine absorb water and undigested food in the solid form reaches the rectum and excreted out through the anus. The glands which are involved in digestion are salivary glands, liver and pancreas. . 14 ","BREATHING AND EXCHANGE OF GASES All biological activities require energy which is released by the breakdown of food. So all organisms consume high energy organic molecules in the form of food. The breakdown of food by the use of oxygen is called oxidation. Cells utilize Oxygen for catabolism and produce energy along with oxygen. The process of exchange between oxygen from the atmosphere and carbon dioxide produced by the cells is called breathing. The method by which oxidation of food material occur in the living cells of an organism is called respiration and the term respiration was coined by Dutrochet. During oxidation, stored chemical energy in food is released and is temporarily stored in ATP. The first step in respiration is breathing. The food substance which is involved in respiration is called respiratory substrate. E.g.: Glucose, Amino acids, Fatty acids etc. 17. 1 Respiratory Organs: According to the body structure and habitat, breathing mechanism varies . Respiratory Organs Organisms Moist skin, Lungs Amphibians Entire Body surface Sponges, coelenterate, flatworms. Skin Earthworm. Tracheal system Insects Gills Pisces, aquatic arthropods, molluscs Lungs Mammals. 17.1.1 Human respiratory system: It consists of the external nostrils, nasal cavities, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. Respiratory system starts with a pair of external nostrils which leads to a nasal chamber through the nasal passage. The nasal cavities are lined by mucous membrane which secretes mucous. It keeps the nasal cavity moist and traps dust and other foreign particles in the inhaled air. Hairs are also present in the nasal cavity which filters out the dust from the air. The nasal cavities open into the posterior part of the pharynx. 1 ","Pharynx is the common passage for respiratory system and digestive system. The part of the pharynx behind the buccal cavity for the passage of food is called oropharynx and the part for air passage is called nasopharynx. The part of the pharynx behind the larynx is called laryngeopharynx. On the floor of the nasopharynx there is a slit like opening called glottis which is guarded by a cartilaginous flap of skin called epiglottis. The epiglottis prevents the entry of food into the trachea while swallowing. Glottis leads to a thin walled tube called trachea or wind pipe which runs through the neck in front of the oesophagus. The upper part of the trachea is enlarged to form the larynx or sound box. The wall of the larynx is supported by rings of cartilage such as thyroid cartilage and cricoids cartilage. The thyroid cartilage is the largest and projects externally at the neck region and called as Adam’s ap ple in man. The two folds of mucous membrane stretching across the lumen of the larynx called vocal cords vibrate to produce the sound. The trachea is protected by C shaped cartilaginous rings which prevent the collapsing of the walls of the trachea when there is less air in it. Trachea divides in to bronchi and each bronchus enters into each lungs. The bronchi divide to form the bronchiole. Each bronchiole is further divided into a number of small ducts called alveolar ducts. Each alveolar ducts swells up into a thin walled air sacs called alveolus. Groups of alveoli are called infundibulum. Thus each infundibulum looks like a bunch of grapes. The bronchi, bronchiole and the alveolus comprise the lungs. There are two lungs covered by double layered pleura. Between the pleural membranes is filled with a pleural fluid which reduces friction on the lung- surface. 2 ","Outer pleural membrane is in contact with the thoracic lining and the inner pleural membrane with the lung surface. Conducting part – The function of the conducting part is the transport of the atmospheric air to the alveoli. It also prevents the entry of foreign particles, humidifies and brings the air to body temperature. Exchange part - The site of diffusion of O 2 and CO 2 between blood and atmospheric air. Lungs are located in the thoracic chamber which is limited dorsally by the vertebral column, ventrally by the sternum, laterally by the ribs and on the lower side by the dome-shaped diaphragm. Any change in the volume of the thoracic cavity will be reflected in the lung cavity which is essential for breathing. The steps involved in respiration are Breathing or pulmonary ventilation (where air is drawn in and CO 2 rich alveolar air is released out). Diffusion of gases (O 2 and CO 2 ) across alveolar membrane. Transport of gases by the blood. Diffusion of O 2 and CO 2 between blood and tissues. Oxygen is utilized by the cells for catabolic reactions and resultant release of CO 2 (cellular respiration). 3 ","17.2 Mechanism of breathing: The inflow and outflow of air between atmosphere and the alveoli of the lungs is called breathing which is affected by the expansion and contraction of lungs. The lungs are contracted by two processes • Inspiration • Expiration. Both the process is carried out by creating a pressure gradient between lungs and the atmosphere. Inspiration: Includes muscle contraction, and is an active process consuming mechanical energy. It takes place when the pressure within the lungs becomes less than the atmospheric pressure. Lungs are located in the thorax. During inspiration the diaphragm (the muscular partition wall which separates thorax from abdomen) and some of the intercostals muscles (rib muscles between the ribs) contract. This results in pulling of the ribs upwards and outwards which increase the volume of the thoracic chamber. As a result the sternum causes increase in the volume of the thoracic chamber in the dorsoventral axis. If there is an overall increase in the thoracic volume causes an increase in pulmonary volume. An increase in pulmonary volume decreases the intrapulmonary pressure. So fresh air enters through nose and reaches the lungs. Expiration: when the diaphragm and the inter-costal muscles occurs relax, the diaphragm and sternum come back to their normal positions. It reduces the thoracic volume and the pulmonary volume which leads to an increase in intra-pulmonary pressure. It is slightly greater than the atmospheric pressure causing the expulsion of air from the lungs -expiration. With the help of additional muscles in the abdomen we can increase the strength of inspiration and expiration. A healthy human breathes 12-16 times/minute normally with about 10 litres per minute . The apparatus used to measure the rate of breathing is spirometer or respirometer . 4 ","17.2.1 Respiratory volumes and capacities: The air that passes into and out of the lungs with each respiration is called tidal air . 1. Tidal volume : The volume of air inspired or expired during a normal respiration is called tidal volume. In adult man tidal volume is about 500mL. A healthy man can inspire or expire approximately 6000 to 8000 mL of air per minute. 2. Inspiratory reserve volume : It is the additional volume of air that can be inspired beyond the normal tidal volume by a forcible inspiration. IRV of normal man is about 2000mL-3000 mL. 3. Expiratory reserve volume : It is the additional volume of air that can be expired beyond the normal tidal volume by a forcible expiration. ERV of normal man is about 1100mL off air. 4. Residual volume : The volume of air that remains inside the lungs after a forcible expiration is called residual volume. The RV of normal man is about 1100- 1200mL.The residual volume is always present in lungs. So the gaseous exchange continues in the lungs even after a forcible expiration. 5. Pulmonary capacity : When any two or more pulmonary volumes considered together, such a capacity is called pulmonary capacity. The important pulmonary capacities are Inspiratory capacity : The total volume of air a person can take in after a normal expiration is called inspiratory capacity. In it inspiratory reserve volume and tidal volume are included. IC= TV + IRV 3500 + 500mL=3500mL Expiratory capacity : It is the amount of air a person can expire after a normal inspiration. EC= TV + ERV. Functional Residual Capacity : The amount of air which remains inside the lungs after normal expiration. It includes expiratory reserve volume and residual volume. FRC + ERV + RV 5 ","2500mL + 1000mL + 1500 mL Vital capacity : It is the amount of air that can be expired with forceful efforts after a deepest inspiration. It includes inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve volume and tidal volume. VC = IRV + ERV + TV 4500mL= 3000mL + 500mL + 1000mL Total Lung Capacity : The maximum amount of air lungs can hold is the total lung capacity. It includes inspiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, expiratory reserve volume and residual volume. TLC + IRV + TV + ERV + RV Or TLC = VC + RV 17.3 Exchange of Gases: The primary sites of exchange of gases takes place in the alveoli. The exchange of gases is between blood and tissues. Exchange of gases occurs by simple diffusion based on pressure gradient or concentration gradient. The important factors affecting diffusion are solubility of gases and the thickness of the membrane. Partial pressure is the pressure by an individual gas in a mixture of gases .It is represented as pO 2 for oxygen and pCO 2 for carbon dioxide. 6 ","The amount of CO 2 which can diffuse through the diffusion membrane is higher than the partial pressure of O2. The diffusion membrane is made up of squamous epithelium of alveoli, the alveolar capillaries endothelium and the basement substance in between them and its total thickness is less than a millimetre.  All the various factors of our body favour the diffusion of O 2 from alveoli to tissues and that of CO 2 from tissues to alveoli. 17.4 Transport of Gases: It is through the blood the transport for O 2 and CO 2 takes place and 97 % of O2 is transported by the RBCs and remaining 3% through the plasma. 20-25 % of CO 2 is transported through RBCs and 70 % is carried as bicarbonate. 7 % of CO 2 is carried out through plasma. 17.4.1 Transport of oxygen: The red coloured iron containing pigment in RBC is haemoglobin and they bond with oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin and this binding is related to partial pressure of oxygen. Four molecules of oxygen can be carried by a single haemoglobin. Binding is affected by the partial pressure of CO 2 , hydrogen ion concentration and temperature 7 ","When the relationship of haemoglobin with oxygen is expressed by the plotting of oxygen saturation of blood against the pO2 of oxygen, an S shaped curve or sigmoid curve is obtained and is called oxygen dissociation curve or oxygen haemoglobin dissociation curve. When there is high pO 2 , low pCO 2 , lesser H + concentration and lower temperature, in the alveoli, oxyhaemoglobin is formed. In the tissues, low pO 2 , high pCO 2 , high H + concentration and higher temperature happens, dissociation of oxygen takes place from oxyhaemoglobin. So oxygen binds to haemoglobin on the lung surface and is dissociated in the tissues. Under normal physiological conditions 100 mL of oxygenated blood gives about 5mL of oxygen under normal conditions. 17.4.2 Transport of Carbon dioxide: CO 2 combines with haemoglobin to form carbamino-haemoglobin and is related to the partial pressure of CO 2 . Partial pressure of O 2 affects the binding up of carbon dioxide with haemoglobin. More binding happens if partial pressure of CO 2 is high and partial pressure of O 2 is low as in the tissues more carbon dioxide binding occurs. When the pCO 2 is low and pO 2 is high as in the alveoli, dissociation of CO 2 takes place to from carbamino-haemoglobin. RBCs have high concentration of carbonic anhydrase enzyme .Only very less amount of this enzyme is present in the plasma. In the tissue the partial pressure of CO 2 is high because of catabolism, CO 2 diffuses into blood to form HCO 3 and H+. In the alveolus partial pressure of CO 2 is low, CO 2 and H 2 are formed. The carbon dioxide is trapped as bicarbonate. It is transported from the tissue to the alveoli and carbon dioxide is released out. For every 100 ml of deoxygenated blood, 4 mL of carbon dioxide are delivered approximately. 8 ","17.5 Regulation of respiration: The process of respiration or respiratory rhythm is controlled by the nervous system. The rate of respiration is changed as per Oxygen demand of the body. The regulatory centre for respiration is known as the respiratory centre. It consists of a number of neurons located bilaterally in the medulla oblongata of the brain. There are three groups of respiratory centres- respiratory rhythm centre, pneumotaxic centre and chemosensitive area. Respiratory rhythm centre : It is the group of neurons located in the dorsal portion of medulla oblongata. It is a specialized centre which is responsible for the regulation of respiration. This group of neurons produces the basic respiratory rhythm. The nervous signals released from the neurons of respiratory rhythm centre are transmitted to the diaphragm which is the primary inspiratory muscle. These signals cause the inspiratory muscle or diaphragm to contract and bring about inspiration. Pneumotaxic centre : It is a group of neurons located dorsally in the upper pons of the brain. It can moderate the functions of the respiratory rhythm centre. The signal from the neurons of pneumotaxic centre determines the number and depth of breaths. A strong signal from the pneumotaxic centre causes increased rate of breathing due to the shortening of both inspiration and expiration. The neural signals from pneumotaxic centre can also reduce the duration of inspiration and thereby alter the respiration rate. Chemo sensitive centre : This is an area situated adjacent to the respiratory rhythm centre which is highly sensitive to CO2 and hydrogen ions. The concentration of hydrogen ions and CO2 cause an increase in the inspiratory signal and expiratory signal. Oxygen has no direct effect on respiratory signals. The increased concentration of CO2 and Hydrogen ions in the chemo sensitive area activates this centre and chemo sensitive area transmit signals to the respiratory rhythm centre and make adjustments in the respiratory process by which these substances can be eliminated. Receptors associated with aortic arch and carotid artery recognize the changes in the concentration of CO2 and hydrogen ions .They send necessary signals to the respiratory rhythm centre for immediate control actions. 17.6 Disorders of the respiratory system : Respiratory systems of humans is affected by many respiratory diseases and are called respiratory disorders. Common disorders are asthma, emphysema, and occupational respiratory disorders. Asthma : The difficulty in breathing causing wheezing due to inflammation of bronchi and bronchioles is called asthma. Emphysema : It is a chronic obstructive disease of lungs. It is an inflation or abnormal distension of the alveolar wall resulting in the loss of elasticity of their walls. The alveolar walls degenerate and alveoli combine to form large alveoli. The alveoli remain fully filled with air even during expiration. This will lead to increase in lung size and the major cause of emphysema is cigarette smoking. Occupational respiratory disorders : The pulmonary disease caused due to the exposure of potentially harmful substances like gas, fumes, or dusts, present in the working environment of a person are called occupational respiratory disorders. The common examples are silicosis (caused in workers employed in mining industry, quarry etc due to chronic exposure to silica dust from rocks or stones) and asbestosis (in workers employed in asbestos factory due to chronic exposure to asbestos dust). FAST TRACK REVISION: 9 ","Cells use oxygen to produce energy from the nutrient metabolism and also produce waste products which are harmful in nature to the cells. Animals have several methods for the exchange of gases between the air and body tissues through blood. There is a respiratory system which exchange gases for the body through several processes occurring in sequential order. The start of this process is through breathing in which the atmospheric air is taken in and alveolar air is thrown out. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between deoxygenated blood and alveoli, transport of all the nutrients along with gases are the events that occur. Inspiration and expiration are the two mechanism of respiration. It is carried out by creating pressure gradients between the atmosphere and alveoli. Volumes of air that are involved during respiration can be estimated with the help of spirometer and have clinical significance. The diffusion of gases is dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide, their solubility as well as thickness of the diffusion surface. All these factors work together to diffuse the oxygen from the alveoli to the deoxygenated tissues and Carbon dioxide from the deoxygenated tissues to the blood. Oxygen forms oxyhaemoglobin when comes in contact with the haemoglobin. Respiratory rhythm is regulated from the medulla oblongata which is the respiratory centre in the brain. 10 ","Body Fluids and Circulation Blood It is a fluid connective tissue composed of liquid plasma (forms the matrix) and cellular components ( RBCs, WBCs and the platelets). Fig. 1. Elements of the blood Plasma The matrix of blood is a fluid made of plasma. It is a straw colored, viscous fluid constituting about 55 percent of the blood. Different proteins are present in plasma such as fibrinogen, globulins, and albumins. Fibrinogens help clot blood. Albumins help to maintain osmotic balance in the body. Globulins functions as defensive proteins. Minerals such as sodium ions, calcium ions, magnesium ions, bicarbonate ions, are useful in maintaining equilibrium and also in transport and uptake of nutrients. Apart from these, amino acids and glucose are also present in plasma. Formed elements Formed elements include erythrocytes, leucocytes, and blood platelets. These are different types of blood cells that has different roles. Erythrocytes also known as red blood cells. They are the most abundant cells in the blood. The site of formation of red blood cells is bone marrow. They are biconcave in shape and enucleated (without the nucleus). They carry iron containing protein known as hemoglobin. Hemoglobin helps in the transport of oxygen and carbon-dioxide in blood. The average life span of RBCs is 120 days. A healthy person has around 12-15 gm of hemoglobin per 100 ml of blood. Spleen is known as the graveyard of RBC. Leucocytes also known as white blood cells. They appear colorless as they do not have hemoglobin. They have a short life span of 3 to 4 days. They are of two types- granulocytes and agranulocytes. Neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils are granulocytes. Lymphocytes and monocytes are agranulocytes. 1 ","Neutrophils are known as polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Out of all the three granulocytes, neutrophils are most abundant. They are phagocytic cells.  Basophils are least in number in comparison to other granulocytes. They secrete serotonin, histamine, and basophils. So, basophils are involved in inflammatory reactions. Eosinophils are involved in allergic reactions. Blood platelets , also known as thrombocytes . They are produced in bone marrow from the megakaryocytes. They are involved in blood clotting. Any decrease in the number of platelets can cause loss of blood from the body. Blood groups Blood grouping is divided into- ABO blood group and Rh group. ABO blood grouping ABO blood grouping is based on the presence or absence of certain antigens on the surface of RBCs. The two-main surface antigen present on the red blood cells are A and B. There are 4 types of blood group are A, B, AB and O group. Fig. 2. Blood groups and antigen on red blood cells The above table depicts blood groups and donor compatibility. As O blood group do not have any surface antigen, they are said to be universal donor whereas AB are considered universal recipients as they contain both the antigen of their surface. Blood transfusion is done safely based on the blood group of the donor and recipients. Rh grouping 2 ","Rh is also an antigen similar to that present in Rhesus monkey. Individuals having Rh antigen on RBCs are considered as Rh positive whereas those which do not have Rh antigen are considered Rh negative. If Rh -ve person receives Rh +ve blood, the Rh -ve individual will start producing antibodies against it. So, Rh group should also be tested before blood transfusion. An important case of Rh mismatching has been observed when the Rh -ve pregnant mother carry Rh +ve fetus. Rh antigens of the fetus do not get exposed to the Rh-ve blood of the mother in the first pregnancy, due to a barrier known as placenta. But at the time of delivery of the first child, there is a possibility of mixing of the blood of mother with child. Due to this, mother starts to produce antibodies against the Rh antigen. If the mother conceives again, the Rh antibodies from the Rh -ve mother can leak into the blood of the Rh +ve fetus and can destroy the fetal RBCs. This leads to agglutination of red blood cells. This disorder is known as erythroblastosis foetalis . Fetus will anemic and suffers from jaundice. To avoid this, mother should get injected with anti-Rh antibodies instantly after the delivery of the first child. Coagulation of blood Blood clotting is also known as blood coagulation. Blood clotting is observed after any injury or trauma. This helps in preventing excess loss of blood. When an individual gets injured, after some time reddish brown scum is formed at the point of injury. This is known as clot. Clot is made up of network of threads known as fibrils . This network contains dead and damaged formed elements of blood. Fibrils are formed from the conversion of inactive fibrinogen in presence of enzyme thrombin. Thrombin is also formed from inactive form known as prothrombin . Thrombokinase is required for the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin. Platelets release certain factors to begin blood clotting. Calcium ions play an important role during blood clotting. Fig. 3. Blood coagulation 3 ","Lymph Apart from the blood, another fluid found in the body is lymph. Blood circulates in blood capillaries in tissues. Some water along with some water-soluble substances leak out and enter the interstitial spaces. This is known as tissue fluid or interstitial fluid. Exchange of gases, nutrients between the blood and the cells occurs through this fluid. A network of vessels that collects interstitial fluid and drain it to major veins is known as lymphatic system. Lymphatic system contains a fluid known as lymph. Lymphocytes which are an important cell of the immune system are present in lymph. Fig. 4. Lymph Circulatory pathways There are two types of circulatory pathways found- open circulatory system and closed circulatory system. When blood flow in lacunae and sinuses, it is known as open circulatory system. It is found in molluscs, arthropods, etc. When blood flow in closed vessels it is known as closed circulatory system. For example, humans. Closed circulatory have an advantage over open circulatory system, as blood can flow in a controlled manner in case of closed circulatory system. Vertebrates have muscular, pumping organ known as heart. Fishes have 2 chambered heart. Amphibians have 3 chambered heart except crocodiles (4 chambered heart). Birds, reptiles, and humans have 4 chambered heart. Human circulatory system Human circulatory system consists of heart, blood vessels, and blood. Heart is mesodermal in nature. It is situated in the thoracic cavity, in between the two lungs. 4 ","The double membrane that surrounds the heart is known as pericardium. Pericardium circles the pericardial fluid. Heart is 4 chambers with 2 atria and 2 ventricles. A thin wall separates the left and the right atria. It is called intra-atrial septum . The left and right ventricle are separated by thick intra-ventricular septum . Fig. 5. Human heart The opening between the right atrium and right ventricle is guarded by a valve known as tricuspid valve . The bicuspid or mitral valve guards the opening between the left atrium and the left ventricle. The openings of the right and the left ventricles into the pulmonary artery and the aorta respectively are provided with the semilunar valves . Valves in the heart allows the blood to flow in one direction and thus preventing backflow of blood. Heart is a muscular organ. Heart muscles are known as cardiac muscles. A specialized cardiac musculature called the nodal tissue is also dispersed in the heart. One is present in the upper right corner of the right atrium is known as sinoatrial node or SA node. And one is present in the upper left corner of the right atrium is known as atrio-ventricular node or AV node. A bundle of nodal fibers, atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle) continues from the AVN which passes through the atrio-ventricular septa and divides into a right and left bundle. These branches give rise to minute fibers known as purkinje fibers . SA node is known as the pacemaker of the heart as it has the ability to get excited and can generates an action potential. Cardiac cycle Sequence of electrical and mechanical events at the time of each heart beat is known as cardiac cycle. It consists of two phases- diastole and systole. At the time of diastole, heart ventricles relax which fills them with blood. During systole, ventricles contract to pump the blood into the arteries. Phases of cardiac cycle are as follows- 5 ","Atrial systole consists of contraction of the right and left atria which is followed by electrical stimulation. This increases blood pressure in the both left and right atria. So that the blood can be pumped into ventricles. During this AV valves are open and semilunar valves are closed. It takes about 0.1 seconds. Fig. 6. Cardiac cycle Ventricular systole consists of contraction of the right and the left ventricles which will be followed by electrical stimulation. AV valves are closed during ventricular systole and semilunar valves are open. It takes about 0.3 seconds. Cardiac diastole is a period when heart relaxes to fill the blood. When atria and ventricles relax together, they form complete cardiac diastole. During ventricular diastole, pressure in the ventricles drops below the left atrial pressure, mitral valve opens, and left ventricle gets filled with the blood. Similarly, when the pressure in the right ventricle drops below that in the right atrium, the tricuspid valve opens, and the right ventricle gets filled with blood. During diastole, the pressure within the left ventricle is lower than that in aorta, which allows the blood to circulate in the heart itself with the help of the coronary arteries. Heart sound The heart sound is known as “ lubb-dubb ” sound. The first heart sound lubb is produced when mitral and tricuspid valves gets closed at the beginning of the ventricular systole. The second sound dubb is produced when aortic and pulmonary valves gets closed at the end of ventricular systole. 6 ","Fig. 7. Heart sound Electrocardiograph (ECG): ECG is the graphical representation of heart’s electrical activity during cardiac cycle. The standard ECG consists of various peaks represented by letters P through T. • P-Wave: Represents electrical excitation of atria. It shows the atrial depolarization. • QRS Complex: Represents the ventricular depolarization. This initiates ventricular contraction. The contraction starts soon after Q. • T-Wave : Represents ventricular repolarization. It signifies the return of ventricles to their normal state after excitation. End of T-Wave signifies the end of ventricular systole. Double Circulation: It is a system of circulation in where in a single cycle of circulation, blood passes through the heart twice. It consists of two parts: Pulmonary circulation and systemic circulation. Pulmonary Circulation: Circulation of blood between heart and lungs. Deoxygenated blood from the heart enters the lung for oxygenation and oxygenated blood is returned to the heart. Systemic Circulation: Circulation of blood between the heart and the rest of the body. Oxygenated blood is supplied from the heart to all parts and deoxygenated blood is returned to the heart. Coronary Circulation: Circulation of blood between the heart and the cardiac muscles Hepatic Portal Circulation: System of blood vessels that connect the intestines, liver and the systemic circulation. 7 ","Regulation of cardiac activity: Cardiac activity is regulated by the Autonomous Nervous System (ANS) through the neural center in the medulla oblongata. The sympathetic nervous system will increase cardiac output by increasing heart rate and the strength of ventricular contractions. The parasympathetic nervous system will decrease the cardiac output by decreasing the heart rate and the strength of the ventricular contractions. Cardiac output can also be influenced by certain adrenal medullary hormones. Disorders of circulatory system: Hypertension: When blood pressure is higher than normal, a person suffers from hypertension or high blood pressure. Normal blood pressure is 120/80 mm of Hg. 120mm Hg is the systolic pressure whereas 80mm Hg is the diastolic pressure. When the blood pressure rises above 140/90 mm of Hg it indicates hypertension. It causes problems with the vital organs like heart, kidneys and brain. Coronary heart disease: Also called as artherosclerosis , this diseases is characterized by narrowing of lumen of the arteries due to deposition of calcium, fat, cholesterol and fibrous tissue. It affects blood supply to the heart muscles. Angina: Also called as angina pectoris, it is characterized by acute chest pain due to insufficient oxygen reaching the heart muscles. Heart failure: Inefficient pumping of blood by the heart caused usually due to congestion of heart. Hence it is also called as congestive heart failure. 8 ","Excretory products and their elimination Different harmful substances are formed due to different metabolic reaction in the body. It includes, urea, uric acid, ammonia, carbon-dioxide, water, ions etc. The three-main nitrogenous waste are urea, ammonia and uric acid. Ammonia is the most toxic out of these. Animals excreting ammonia as nitrogenous waste are known as ammonotelic , for example, most bony fishes, aquatic amphibians etc. The excretion of ammonia occurs via diffusion. The organisms which excrete urea as nitrogenous waste, they are known as ureotelic . For example, mammals, amphibians etc. are ureotelic. Those organisms which excrete uric acid as nitrogenous waste, they are known as uricotelic , such as, reptiles, birds etc. Excretory organs in variety of organisms Different organisms have different excretory structures. Amoeba and Paramecium have contractile vacuole for excretion. Canal system is the excretory system found in sponges. Sponges have canal system for excretion. Hydra have coelenteron as excretory in function. Flame cells are found in Platyhelminthes. Nephridia are found in Annelids such as earthworm. Prawns have green glands for excretion. Malpighian tubules form the excretory system in insects. Human excretory system Human excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra. Kidneys are bean shaped and lie in the abdominal cavity. The right kidney is placed slightly lower than the left kidney. The inner surface of the kidney is concave whereas outer surface of the kidney is convex. Towards the center of the inner concave surface of the kidney is a notch called hilum. Hilum is a point where Ureter, blood vessels and nerves enter. Inner to the hilum is a funnel-shaped space known as renal pelvis with projections known as calyces. Kidneys are divided into two regions- outer and inner. The outer part is known as the cortex and inner part is known as medulla. The medulla is divided into conical masses known as medullary pyramids. Extension of renal cortex which separates the pyramids is known as column of Bertini. 1 ","Fig. 1. Human excretory system Nephrons are the structural functional unit of kidneys. Nephron consists of two major parts- renal corpuscle and renal tubule. A tuft of the capillaries forms the glomerulus. Afferent arteriole brings blood into the glomerulus and leaves the efferent arteriole carries blood out of the glomerulus. Glomerulus is bound by a cup- shaped structure known as Bowman’s capsule. Bowman’s capsule together with glomerulus is known renal corpuscles or Malpighian body. 2 ","Fig. 2. Structure of the nephrons The tubule extends to form a highly coiled structure known as proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). The next part of the tubule is Henle’s loop. Henle’s loop consists of ascending and descending limb. The ascending limb extends to form distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The DCT then opens into collecting duct. Cortical nephrons and medullary nephrons are the two main types of nephrons. When loop of Henle is too short and only small part of it is found in medulla, it is known as cortical nephrons . When loop of Henle is long and spreads into the medulla, they are known as medullary nephrons . Urine formation The three main steps of urine formation are glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and secretion. Glomerular filtration begins when blood enter the glomerulus through afferent arteriole. Water and nitrogenous waste move into the glomerulus and blood cells, proteins exit the glomerulus through efferent arteriole. On an average, kidney filters about 1100 ml to 1200 ml of blood per minute. The glomerular capillary blood pressure causes filtration of blood through 3 different layers. The first layer is known as endothelium that surround the glomerular blood vessels, the other is epithelium of Bowman’s capsule and a basement membrane is present between the two layers. The epithelial cells present in the Bowman’s capsule are known as podocytes which are arranged in an intricate manner to leave some minute spaces called slit pores or filtration slits. Glomerular filtration rate is defined as the amount of filtrate produced by the kidneys per minute. Fig. 3. Steps of urine formation 3 ","Tubular reabsorption involves the absorption of required molecules or ions such as sodium ions, glucose, amino acids etc. Some of the substances are absorbed actively and some are absorbed passively. Glucose and amino acids are absorbed actively whereas water is absorbed passively. The last step of urine formation is secretion. Potassium ions, hydrogen ions, ammonia are secreted out to maintain the ionic and acid balance of the body fluids. Function of the tubules Proximal convoluted tubules (PCT) is lined by simple cuboidal brush border epithelium. This type of epithelium helps in providing increased surface area for reabsorption. Most of the electrolytes and water are reabsorbed in PCT. It helps to maintaining the pH and ionic balance of the body fluids by secretion of hydrogen ions, potassium ions, ammonium ions into the filtrate. Henle’s loop, is very important in maintaining the osmolarity of the fluid. Very less reabsorption occurs in ascending limb. It is impermeable to water, but permeable to electrolyte. Descending limb absorbs most of the water, making the filtrate concentrated. Descending limb is almost impermeable to any electrolyte. So, different part of Henle’s loop reabsorb differently. Fig. 4. Function of the tubules In Distal convoluted tubule, the reabsorption of water, sodium ions and bicarbonate ions occur whereas secretion of potassium ions and hydrogen ions occurs to maintain the ionic balance of the fluid. 4 ","Collecting duct, reabsorbs large amount of water to make the urine concentrated. Secretion of hydrogen ions and potassium ions also takes place in collecting duct. It maintains the ionic balance and pH of blood. Regulation of kidney function There main parts are involved in kidney regulation- hypothalamus, juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) and heart. Any change in the blood volume, ionic balance triggers the osmoreceptors in the body. This stimulates the hypothalamus to secrete antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is also known as vasopressin . This helps in the reabsorption of water from the tubules. This increases the blood volume and switch off the osmoreceptors through negative feedback mechanism. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is activated during fall in glomerular blood pressure. Juxtaglomerular cells then release an enzyme known as renin, which converts angiotensinogen in blood to angiotensin I which gets further transformed to angiotensin II . Angiotensin II is an effective vasoconstrictor, so it increases the glomerular blood pressure. Angiotensin II also acts on adrenal cortex to release hormone, aldosterone to increase sodium ion and water reabsorption from the distal tubules. This mechanism is known as renin-angiotensin mechanism. Fig. 5. Regulation of kidney function by renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system Heart releases a polypeptide hormone known as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) which causes vasodilation to decrease the blood pressure. It acts as a negative feedback mechanism for renin-angiotensin mechanism. Micturition: It is the process of release of urine from the body. It is controlled by the CNS through various neural mechanisms. 5 ","Other Organs in Excretion: Lungs, kidneys, liver and skin function to eliminate wastes like carbon dioxide, toxic substances, urea, etc. Disorders of the excretory system: Uremia: Accumulation of urea in blood due to malfunctioning of kidneys. Acute renal failure: One or both kidneys completely fail and are unable to function due to various reasons. Renal calculi: Insoluble kidney stones formed as a result of accumulation of insoluble crystals like oxalates. Glomerulonephritis: Inflammation of glomerulus. Hemodialysis can be done to remove excess urea from blood in cases of malfunctioning of kidney. Blood is taken out of the body through cellophane tubules and dialyzed against an isotonic liquid so as to remove wastes and the filtered blood is pumped back into the body. 6 ","Locomotion and Movement Locomotion and movement Movement is defined as when organism moves from one location to another location. When movement result in change in position or location, it is known as locomotion. For example, walking, climbing, running etc. Types of movement Ciliary, amoeboid, and muscular are three types of movement. Ciliary movement This type of movement occurs in organs lined by ciliated epithelium. It is used to trap dust particles that enter during inhalation. It also helps in movement of ova from the fallopian tube into the uterus. Fig. 1. Ciliary movement in Paramecium Amoeboid movement This type of movement is observed in some immune cells such as macrophages, leucocytes etc. It is also observed in Amoeba , which moves through pseudopodia. Fig. 2. Amoeboid movement in Amoeba 1 ","Muscular movement Muscular movement is observed in tongue, jaws, limbs etc. For locomotion, muscular, skeletal, and neural system are involved. Muscle Muscle or muscular tissue is mesodermal in nature. It is a tissue involved in movement of the body. Skeletal muscles, visceral muscles, and cardiac muscles are three main types of muscles. Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles (under the control of our will) which are under the control of somatic nervous system. They are striated muscles as they have characteristic cross-striations. Muscles are attached to bones via tendons. They are involved in different body movements and body posture. Smooth muscles are also known as visceral muscles. They are do not have striations. They control involuntary movements in the body. They are found in the lining of alimentary canal, reproductive tract, etc. Cardiac muscles are muscles of the heart that help in the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart. They are involuntary muscles. They have cross-striations with branching pattern. Fig. 3. Types of muscles Structure of the muscle 2 ","A number of muscle bundles in a skeletal muscles form fascicle . Each muscle bundle is made up of a number of muscle fibers . The plasma membrane that lines the muscle fiber is known as Sarcolemma. Sarcolemma encloses the sarcoplasm. Multiple nuclei found in the muscle fiber is known as syncytium . The endoplasmic reticulum of the muscle fiber is known as sarcoplasmic reticulum. Sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions that participate in muscle contraction. Muscle fiber contain parallelly arranged filaments which are known as myofibrils or myofilaments . The fibrous tissue that surround the skeletal muscle is known as epimysium. Fig. 4. Structure of the muscles The characteristic cross-striations found in skeletal muscles is due to the presence of two proteins- actin and myosin . The light bands also known as isotropic , contain actin protein, whereas dark band are known as anisotropic which contain myosin. Thin filaments are known as actin filaments whereas thick filaments are known as myosin filaments. In the center of each actin band there is a stretch of the elastic fiber known as Z-line. The portion of the myofibril between the two successive Z lines is known as sarcomere . Sarcomere is known as the functional unit for muscle contraction. 3 ","Fig. 5. Structure of sarcomere Structure of contractile proteins The two main contractile proteins are actin and myosin. The monomeric unit of actin is known as G actin or globular actin. Polymers of G actin form F actin or F filaments. Two F filaments wrap around each other to form actin molecule. A protein tropomyosin, run around the F actin. Another protein, troponin is distributed at regular intervals on tropomyosin. Fig. 6. Structure of the actin Monomeric units of myosin are known as Meromyosins. Each meromyosin has two parts: globular head and a long tail. 4 ","Fig. 7. Structure of the myosin Head has ATPase activity and actin binding site. Mechanism of muscle contraction The muscle contraction is explained using sliding filament theory. During the muscle contraction, thin filaments slide over thick filaments. Muscle contraction begins when a signal is transmitted from the central nervous system to a motor neuron. The junction between the motor neuron and muscle fiber is known as neuromuscular junction. Release of the neurotransmitter such as acetylcholine at neuromuscular junction generates action potential in the sarcolemma. Action potential induces the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions into the sarcoplasm. Increase in calcium level causes calcium ions to bind to troponin on actin filaments. This unveils the active sites for myosin binding. The ATPase activity of myosin exposes sites to allow cross bridge formation between actin and myosin. This causes shortening of sarcomere to bring the muscle contraction. 5 ","Fig. 8. Sliding filament theory The calcium ion are then pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This step masks the actin filaments bringing muscles to its original position. Lactic acid formation in muscles Repeated muscle activation leads to lactic acid accumulation in muscles, for example, during exercise or running. This occurs due to anaerobic breakdown of glycogen in muscles. This causes muscle pain and fatigue. Skeletal system Skeletal system consists of bones and cartilages. It helps in the movement of the body. Bones are hard due to presence of calcium salts whereas cartilage is flexible because of the presence of chondroitin sulphate. Humans contain 206 bones and few cartilages. The skeletal system has two divisions- axial skeletal system and appendicular skeletal system. Axial skeletal system consists of 80 bones. It comprises of skull, sternum, vertebral column, and ribs. Fig. 9. Axial skeletal system Skull consist of facial and cranial bones which are 22 in number. Cranial bones are 8 in number which protects the brain. The facial region consists of 14 skeletal elements which form the front part of the skull. Hyoid bone which is U-shaped in structure is present at the base of the buccal cavity. Each middle ear consists of three small bones – Malleus, Incus, and Stapes. They are together known as Ear Ossicles . Vertebral column consists of 33 vertebrae. It extends from the base of the skull and forms the main framework of the trunk. Each vertebra has a central hollow part known as neural canal through which the spinal cord passes. 6 ","Fig. 10. Vertebral column First vertebra is known as the atlas and it articulates with the occipital condyles. The vertebral column is divided into 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 1 sacral and 1 coccygeal regions starting from the skull. The number of cervical vertebrae is conserved among the mammals. Sternum is a flat bone on the ventral midline of thorax. There are 12 pairs of ribs that are attached to the sternum. First seven pairs of ribs are known as true ribs as they are directly attached to the sternum. The 8th, 9th and 10 th pairs of ribs join the seventh rib instead of joined directly to the sternum. They are known as false ribs. Last 2 pairs (11 th and 12th) pair of ribs are not connected directly to the sternum, they are known as floating ribs. Thoracic vertebrae, ribs and sternum combines to form rib cage. 7 ","Fig. 11. Sternum Appendicular skeleton consists of bones of limbs and girdles . Each limb is made of 30 bones. The bones of the forelimbs or hands are humerus, radius and ulna, carpals (wrist bones which are 8 in number), metacarpals (palm bones which are 5 in number) and phalanges (digits which are 14 in number). Fig. 12. Bones of forelimbs The bones of the hind limbs or legs are- Femur, the thigh bone (longest bone), tibia and fibula, tarsals (ankle bones) which are 7 in number, metatarsals are 5 in number and phalanges are 14 in number. Knee cap contains a cup shaped bone known as patella. 8 ","Fig. 13. Bones of hindlimbs Pectoral girdle consists of two bones clavicle and scapula. Scapula contains the cavity known as glenoid cavity which forms ball and socket joint with the humerus. It articulates with the forelimb bones. Fig. 14. Bones of pectoral girdle Pelvic girdle contains a cup shaped cavity known as acetabulum that forms ball and socket joint with the femur. It articulates with the hind limb bones. The muscles of the hip are attached to pelvic girdle. Fig. 15. Bones of pelvic girdle Joints: 9 ","Joints are junctions between bones or between bone and cartilage. They are essential for locomotion as they act as fulcrum for the force applied by the muscles to cause movement. There are three major structural types of joints: 1. Synovial joints: A characteristic fluid-filled synovial cavity is present between the two bones. This joint gives greater flexibility and more movement. Some examples are hinge joint (knee and elbow), ball and socket joint (shoulder and hip), pivot joint (neck), etc. 2. Fibrous joints: Bones join by means of dense fibrous tissues forming sutures. They are immovable. They are seen in the joints between the flat bones of the cranium. 3. Cartilaginous joints: Cartilage is present and helps in joining two bones together. These joints are partially movable. They are found between the vertebrae. Disorders of the muscular and skeletal system: Myasthenia gravis: Affects neuromuscular junction. Causes fatigue, weakening and paralysis of skeletal muscles. It is an autoimmune disorder. Muscular dystrophy: A genetic disorder causing progressive degradation of skeletal muscle. Tetany: Low calcium ion levels in body fluid causing rapid spasms in muscles. Arthritis: Inflammation of joints Gout: Accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joint causing joint inflammation. Osteoporosis: Decrease in bone mass causing increased risk of fractures. It is age-related and usually due to decreased oestrogen levels. 10 ","Neural control and coordination The process by which two or more organs interact with each other and complement each other ’s function is known as coordination. Neural system The structural and functional unit of neural system are known as neurons. They can detect, receive, and transmit stimuli. Human nervous system Human neural or nervous system is classified into two types- central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). Central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord whereas peripheral nervous system consists of all the nerves present in the brain and the spinal cord. The PNS has two types of nerve fibers- afferent nerve fibers and efferent nerve fibers. Afferent nerve fibers carry impulses from organs/tissues to the CNS whereas efferent nerve fibers transmit nerve impulses from CNS to the target tissue/organ. PNS is divided into somatic nervous system and autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system transmits impulses from the CNS to skeletal muscles while the autonomic nervous system transmits impulses from the CNS to the involuntary organs and smooth muscles of the body. The autonomic nervous system is classified into sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system. Fig. 1. Types of nervous system Structure and the function of neuron 1 ","The structural and the functional unit of nervous system is neuron. It consists of 3 parts- cell body, dendrites, and axon. Cell body contains cytoplasm that contain granular bodies known as Nissl’s granules. Finger-like projections that arises from cell body are known as dendrites. Dendrites transmit nerve impulses towards the cell body. From the cell body arises a long axon, whose distal end is branched. Each axon terminates into a bulb-like structure known as synaptic knob, which contains neurotransmitter. The cells of the axon which are covered by myelin sheath are known as Schwann cells . The gap between the two-adjacent myelin sheath are known as Nodes of Ranvier . Fig. 2. Structure of the neuron Types of neurons Multipolar neurons are those neurons that with one axon and two or more dendrites. For example, in cerebral cortex. Bipolar neurons are with one axon and one dendrite. For example, retina. Unipolar neurons are with one axon, no dendrite. For example, embryonic stage. 2 ","Fig. 3. Types of neuron Generation and conduction of nerve impulses Neurons are cells that can be stimulated and excited electrically. Therefore, their membranes are in polarized state . Membrane of neurons contain selectively permeable ion channels with varying permeability to different ions. When no nerve impulse is being transmitted, the membrane is more permeable to potassium ions and impermeable to sodium ions. This condition is known as resting membrane potential. So, inside the membrane high concentration of potassium ions is present as compared to sodium ions. But outside the membrane, sodium concentration is high as compared to potassium ions. The difference in the concentration of these ions creates a concentration gradient. This gradient is maintained by sodium-potassium pump that actively transport 3 sodium ions outside and 2 potassium ions inside the neuronal membrane. As a result, outer surface of the axonal membrane possesses a positive charge and its inner surface becomes negatively charged. That is why the membrane is said to be polarized. 3 ","Fig. 4. Membrane potential When a stimulus reaches a neuronal membrane, the membrane becomes freely permeable to sodium ions. This will cause influx of sodium ions inside the neuronal membrane. Due to this the polarity of the membrane changes, the inner side of the membrane becomes positively charged whereas outside the membrane is negatively charged. The electrical potential difference created is known as action potential . After some time, the permeability of sodium ions decreases, and permeability of potassium ion increases. The efflux of sodium ion occurs from inside to outside of the axonal membrane. Again, the polarity is reversed. This sequence of events is repeated along the full axon and as a result nerve impulse is conducted. Transmission of impulses Nerve impulse transmission occurs from one neuron to another neuron through junctions known as synapses . Synapse is junction connecting the membrane of pre-synaptic neuron and post-synaptic neuron separated by a gap known as synaptic cleft . Synapses are of two types- electrical synapse and chemical synapse. In electrical synapse, pre- and post-synaptic neuron are close to each other. Electric current can directly flow from one neuron to another neuron. This mode of nerve impulse transmission is faster than the chemical synapse. During chemical synapses, pre- and post-synaptic neuron are separated by a fluid filled space known as synaptic cleft. Neurotransmitters are involved in chemical synapses. The axon terminals contain vesicles which are filled with neurotransmitters. When the impulse reaches the axon terminal, synaptic vesicles move towards the membrane and fuse with it. This results in the release of the neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft. The released neurotransmitters then bind the receptors on the post-synaptic neuron. This opens ion channels and as a result nerve impulse is transmitted. 4 ","Fig. 5. Chemical synapses Central nervous system Brain acts as a command and control system. Human brain is protected inside the skull. Brain is covered by 3 layers known as meninges. They are as follows- outermost dura mater , middle arachnoid , and innermost pia mater . The brain is divided into forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Forebrain consists of 3 parts- cerebrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus . Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. Cerebrum is divided into two halves known as left and right cerebral hemispheres. These hemispheres are connected by a tract of nerve fibers known as corpus callosum . Cerebral hemispheres are covered by a layer of cells known as cerebral cortex. The area present at the center of the forebrain is known as thalamus . It is involved in sensory and motor signaling. At the base of the thalamus lies the hypothalamus . It controls urge for eating, drinking and body temperature. 5 ","Fig. 6. Structure of human brain Midbrain is located between the forebrain and hindbrain. It contains 4 lobes known as Corpora Quadrigemina . Hind brain comprises of pons, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata . Cerebellum is the second largest part of the brain. The connection between the brain and spinal cord is known as medulla oblongata . Medulla controls gastric secretion, control respiration and cardiovascular functions. Reflex action and reflex arc The involuntary response towards any stimulus is known as reflex action. The pathway of reflex action is known as reflex arc . Reflex arc or reflex pathway consist of afferent neuron and efferent neuron that connect at the spinal cord. The afferent neuron receives signal from a sensory organ. The signal is then transmitted through a dorsal nerve root into the CNS comprising the spinal cord. The efferent neuron then carries signals from CNS to the effector organ or muscle. Fig. 7. Reflex arc Sensory perception and processing Sensory organs detect the changes in the environment and send signals to the central nervous system. Human Eye Eyes are situated in the sockets of the skull known as orbits. Human eye is spherical in structure. It is composed of 3 layers- the outermost sclera (dense connective tissue), middle choroid (supplied with blood vessels) and innermost retina. Choroid becomes thick anteriorly and it forms ciliary body. The visible colored portion of the eye is known as iris. A transparent, crystalline lens is held by ligaments which are attached to the ciliary body. 6 ","Retina consists of 3 layers of neuronal cells- ganglion cells, bipolar cells, and photoreceptor cells. Rods and cones are two types of photoreceptor cells. These cells contain light sensitive proteins. Cones are meant for bright light and color vision whereas rods are meant for dim light. Rods contain protein known as rhodopsin. Cones respond to 3 different colors- red, green, and blue. Fig. 8. Structure of human eye Optic nerve is the nerve that connects eye to the brain. Photoreceptors are absent in this region, hence it is known as blind spot. Lateral to the blind spot lies the macula lutea, which is densely packed with only cones. Macula lutea is a place where visual resolution is highest. The fluid filled space between the cornea and the lens is known as aqueous chamber and fluid is known as aqueous humor . Similarly, the space between the lens and the retina is known as vitreous chamber and the fluid in it is known as vitreous humor . Mechanism of vision When light rays are focused on the retina, they generate action potential in rods and cones. Due to this, a photosensitive pigment separates into opsin (protein component) and retinal (aldehyde of vitamin A). This generates action potential which travels from optic nerve to the visual cortex of the brain. This leads to the image formation on the retina. The ear Hearing and balancing are the two main functions of ears. Ear is divided into 3 parts- outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. The outer ear consists of pinna and external auditory meatus. Pinna collects the vibration from the air and produces sound. Wax secreting gland are present in pinna and meatus. 7 ","Fig. 9. Structure of ear The middle ear consists of 3 ossicles- malleus, incus, and stapes. Middle ear is connected to pharynx by a eustachian tube. Inner ear comprises of bony labyrinth that contains 3 semicircular canals. The coiled part of the labyrinth is known as cochlea. The space within the cochlea is filled with endolymph. Structure located on the basilar membrane is known as organ of corti. They contain hair cells that acts as auditory receptors. Mechanism of hearing The external ear receives sound waves and transfer it to ear drum. This in turn vibrates the ear drum which transfers the vibrations to the ear ossicles. The vibrations are further transferred to cochlea. This generates the nerve impulse which are transmitted via auditory nerve to the auditory cortex of the brain. The structural and functional unit of neural system are known as neurons. They can detect, receive, and transmit stimuli. 8 ","Chemical coordination and integration Endocrine glands Endocrine glands are ductless glands. Their secretions are known as hormones. They are produced in small amount and are intracellular messengers. Human endocrine system Endocrine glands are located in different parts of the human body. Different endocrine glands are pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, adrenal and gonads. Kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract also produces some hormones. The hypothalamus Hypothalamus is located at the base of the forebrain. The group of secretory cells present in the hypothalamus are known as nuclei that produces hormones. The hormones secreted by the hypothalamus regulates the synthesis and secretion of pituitary hormones. Two types of hormones are produced from the hypothalamus- the releasing hormones and the inhibiting hormones. For example, gonadotropic releasing hormone stimulates the release of gonadotropins from the pituitary. These hormones reach the pituitary gland with the help of portal circulatory system. Fig. 1. Hypothalamic hormones The pituitary gland 1 ","Pituitary gland is located in a cavity known as sella tursica which is attached to the hypothalamus via stalk. It has two divisions such as adenohypophysis or anterior pituitary and neurohypophysis or posterior pituitary. Hormones such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone melanocyte stimulating hormone, prolactin, , follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone are secreted by adenohypophysis. Vasopressin and oxytocin are released by neurohypophysis. Fig. 2. Hormones secreted by pituitary glands Hormone Function Growth hormone Regulates general body growth such as increase in the length of the bones, controls fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism etc. Over secretion of growth hormone leads to gigantism whereas low secretion is associates with dwarfism. Adrenocorticotropic hormone Controls the hormones secreted by adrenal cortex. Thyroid stimulating hormone Controls the hormones secreted by thyroid glands. Follicle stimulating Hormone controls maturation of Graafian follicle in females and spermatogenesis in males. Luteinizing hormone Promotes ovulation in females and stimulates the secretion of testosterone in males. 2 ","Prolactin Milk production in mammary glands Oxytocin Is a milk ejecting hormone and also functions during child birth. Vasopressin Also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) helps in reabsorption of water in the distal convoluted tubules. The pineal gland Pineal gland is located on the dorsal side of the forebrain. It secretes a hormone known as melatonin. The function of melatonin is to regulate 24 hours rhythm in body such as body temperature sleep-awake cycle etc. Fig. 3. Hormones secreted by pineal gland Thyroid gland Thyroid glands are located on either side of the trachea. Both lobes are connected by a connective tissue known as isthmus. Thyroid gland consists of follicles and stromal tissues. Thyroid follicles are composed of follicular cells that produces two hormones- tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine (T 4 ) and triiodothyronine (T 3 ). Iodine is an essential element for thyroid hormone synthesis. 3 ","Fig. 4. Structure of thyroid gland Deficiency of thyroid hormone causes hypothyroidism known as goiter. Excess secretion of thyroid hormone causes hyperthyroidism. Thyroid hormones control basal metabolic rate, synthesis of red blood cells, and metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Parathyroid gland They are located at the back side of the thyroid gland and secretes a hormone known as parathyroid hormone or parathormone (PTH). This hormone increases the calcium level in the blood. So, it balances the calcium level in the body. Fig. 5. Structure of parathyroid glands Thymus 4 ","It is located between the lungs behind the sternum. It plays an important part in the development of immune system. This gland secretes a hormone known as thymosin . It participates in cell mediated immunity. It also participates in production of antibodies. Fig. 6. Location of thymus Adrenal gland It is a pair of gland located in the anterior part of the kidney. It is composed of two types of tissues- outer adrenal cortex and inner medulla. Adrenal medulla produces two hormones known as adrenaline and noradrenaline . Adrenaline is also known as emergency hormone as it is secreted at the time of fear, fight, or flight. Adrenaline dilates the pupil increases the alertness, sweating etc. Fig. 7. Detailed structure of adrenal glands 5 ","Adrenal cortex is divided into 3 layers- zona reticularis (inner layer), zona fasciculata (middle layer) and zona glomerulosa (outer layer). Hormones of adrenal cortex are commonly known as corticoids. Corticoids which participate in carbohydrate metabolism are known as glucocorticoids. They stimulate proteolysis, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis. The main glucocorticoid is cortisol which helps in anti-inflammatory reactions and suppresses the immune system. Corticoids that help in water and electrolyte balance are known as mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone is the main hormone of mineralocorticoids. It helps in reabsorption of sodium ions and water and excretion of potassium and phosphate ions. Pancreas It is a dual gland, that is, it is endocrine as well as exocrine in function. Endocrine part of the pancreas consists of islets of Langerhans that is mainly made up of two types of cells- alpha cells and beta cells. Alpha cells secrete hormone known as glucagon whereas beta cells secrete insulin. Glucagon maintains normal blood glucose. It increases blood glucose level. It also promotes gluconeogenesis. So, glucagon is hyperglycemic hormone. Fig. 8. Detailed structure of pancreas Insulin also regulates glucose level in our body. It enhances cellular glucose uptake thus decreases blood glucose level. So, it is known as hypoglycemic hormone. Hyperglycemia causes diabetes mellitus. Testes They are located in scrotal sacs located outside the abdominal cavity. They are primary sex organ as well as endocrine in function. Testis is composed of seminiferous tubules and interstitial cells. Interstitial cells or Leydig cells secrete hormone known as testosterone. This hormone regulates spermatogenesis, development of beards and moustaches, as well as maturation of male accessory sex organs. 6 ","Fig. 9. Hormones secreted by ovaries and testes Ovary In female, a pair of ovaries are located in the abdomen. Ovary is the primary sex organ. It produces two hormones known as estrogen and progesterone. Estrogen helps in ovulation and during menstruation. Progesterone is a pregnancy hormone. Hormones of kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney Heart wall secretes hormone known as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) which decreases the blood pressure. Increase in the blood pressure causes release of ANF as a result blood pressure decreases. Kidney cells secrete hormone known as erythropoietin that promotes RBCs formation. Gastrointestinal tract secretes gastrin, secretin, cholecystokinin, and gastric inhibitory peptide. Mechanism of hormone action Hormones bind to hormone receptor to produce their effects on target tissues. Hormone receptor complex formed will leads to certain biochemical changes in the target tissue. Hormones can interact with membrane receptors as well as intracellular rectors. Steroid receptors are generally intracellular in nature whereas peptide hormones generally bind to membrane receptors. 7 ","Fig. 10. Mechanism of hormone action 8 "]
